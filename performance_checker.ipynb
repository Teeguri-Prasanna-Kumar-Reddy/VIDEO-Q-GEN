              "\"in this course we are going to learn to\\nbuild apps for multiple platforms like\\nAndroid iOS web and desktop from a\\nsingle code base using the flutter\\nframework this course is designed for\\nabsolute beginners infiniter however I\\nhighly recommend you to watch the dart\\nbeginners course present on the channel\\nas this course requires a strong\\nunderstanding of Dart this course solely\\nfocuses on flutter app development and\\ndoes not cover any database related\\ntopics we'll create three apps in this\\ncourse first one is a simple currency\\nconverter app to get started second is\\nthe weather app where all the weather\\ndata is being fetched from the web and\\nthe last one is a shopping app\\nby building these three apps we learn\\nvarious aspects of flutter such as\\nwidgets layouts responsive layouts State\\nManagement\\nEtc\\nadditionally I'll provide you with a\\nbrief overview of the inner workings of\\nflutter like understanding how flutter\\nhandles rendering State Management and\\nmore behind the scene stuff I've covered\\ndatabase related topics in separate\\ntutorials which you can easily follow\\nalong after watching this tutorial\\nbefore starting this course I'd like to\\nthank RF Islam for providing me with the\\nUI of the shop app and Tomic reader and\\nIsmail Alam Khan for helping me set up\\nthe curriculum of this course now let's\\nget started by installing flutter so to\\ninstall flutter you need to make sure\\nyou're on this website flutter.dev then\\nyou can click on docs install flutter\\nand then you'll see a bunch of options\\nto select the operating system on which\\nyou want to install flutter so if you\\nare on Windows or Linux you can click\\neither of them and if you're on Mac you\\ncan click on Mac OS now I won't be able\\nto cover the windows and Linux\\ninstallation processes because I don't\\nhave either of those systems\\nhowever there's one thing I'd like to\\nmention that if you just click over here\\nyou'll get the entire installation\\nprocess and most of it is similar to the\\ninstallation process on Mac OS so we\\nneed to get the flutter SDK we need to\\ndo the Android setup and if there's\\nanything we can do the Windows setup as\\nwell but one thing you need to do\\nadditional is install git if you haven't\\nalready so for flutter you need to have\\ngit pre-installed in your system so you\\ncan click on open a new tab and download\\nthe get installer from here depending on\\nyour system you can either install this\\n32-bit or this which is 64-bit after you\\nhave the installer you can double click\\non it and run it then follow all the\\nprocesses the wizard gives you and then\\nyou'll have get installed in your system\\nto check if it is installed or not you\\ncan go to your system and just type get\\nif you see something like this it means\\nget us installed\\nif it isn't then you haven't installed\\nit properly you need to make sure that\\nit's installed properly all right so\\nlet's clear this off and\\none last thing to mention over here is\\nwhen you have the Windows installation\\nprocess you cannot do iOS setup because\\nyou cannot build apps for iOS from a\\nWindows machine you can only build apps\\nfor Android web and windows from a\\nWindows operating system you can build\\nfor Android web and Linux from a Linux\\noperating system but you cannot build\\nfor iOS or Mac OS from Windows or Linux\\nso that's a point to know that's why if\\nyou see a wire you don't have IOS setup\\nwritten over here\\nhowever if you come to Windows or Mac OS\\ninstallation you'll see iOS setup here\\nwe have xcode which already includes get\\nwhich means we don't have to install git\\nseparately on Mac all right you can see\\nit away flutter users get for\\ninstallation and upgrade we recommend\\ninstalling xcode which includes get but\\nyou can also you install git separately\\nall right so we are just going to\\ninstall it with xcode I already have it\\ninstalled it doesn't make any difference\\nbut if you don't have git installed\\nwe'll install it when we install xq so\\nnow let's dive into this so the first\\npart is to get the flutter SDK\\nso to get the flutter SDK depending on\\nwhat Mac you have Intel Mac or apple\\nsilicon Mac you can select either of\\nthese buttons\\nsince I am on an M1 chip I'm just going\\nto click over here and it will start the\\ninstallation process for me on Windows\\nalso the first part is to get the\\nflutter SDK you'll get only one button\\nto install the flutter SDK on Windows\\nafter that you need to extract the file\\nin the desired location\\nso you need to make sure one particular\\nfolder where you can install it for me I\\nalready know where I want to do it so if\\nI go to found finder press command shift\\nG\\nthen just a forward slash so I go to\\nMacintosh HD\\nput it in a grid format so that it's\\nbetter to see\\nwhere I want to install flutter is users\\ndriven ranavat and over here all right\\nso from the root of my laptop I want to\\ngo to users everyone ranavat and here\\nI'll have the flutter\\nfolder or extract so once the\\ninstallation is complete which I think\\nis complete I'll drag it over here so\\nI'll just open a new finder which has\\ndownloads\\nI'll have flutter over here I'll drag it\\nover here in my advantra now with folder\\nand there we have flutter right here\\ncool now the next step is to add the\\nflutter tool to our path now we can just\\ncopy this Command put it in the terminal\\nand run it and then we'll be able to use\\nflutter specific commands like flutter\\ndoctor\\nbut now you can see flutter command is\\nnot find because I've not run this\\ncommand and if I run this command\\nmeaning I add flutter tool to my path\\nthen run it so it will locate flutter\\ndoctor so it will know what flutter\\ncommand is but when I exit the terminal\\nreopen the terminal again it will forget\\nthe flutter command because it only sets\\nthe path for the current terminal window\\nit doesn't set it for the entire\\nterminal or for the entire system\\nit only does for one window\\nso to permanently add it we have to\\nclick a wire which is permanently\\nupdating a path and follow the steps\\nwritten over here\\nso the first step is to determine the\\npath of our clone of the flutter SDK\\nso we already know where it is from the\\nroot of our folder we need to go to the\\nusers\\nflutter bin so this is our path all\\nright then we need to open or create the\\nRC file for your shell then we need to\\ntype this command in the terminal so\\nlet's go ahead and copy it\\nso we have slash bin slash zsh\\ntyping this command gives us access to\\nwhat shell we are using IV using bash or\\nare we using search shell since it gives\\nus the output as zsh it means we are\\nusing that shell so I need to edit this\\npart right here okay so I'll just copy\\nit then over here I'm going to type Vim\\nwhich is kind of like a code editor so\\nif I just put them\\nlike this I'll be able to edit out zshrc\\nfile right here in the Vim code editor I\\ncan also type Nano\\ninstead of Vim followed by dollar home\\nslash Dot zshrc and that will open it in\\nNano but I'm more comfortable with whim\\nso I'm going to go ahead and use it\\nnow the final step is to copy this line\\nand paste it over here so here we need\\nto mention the path of the flutter get\\ndirectory where is it it's in users\\nso we can\\nbackspace over here but when I try to\\nbackspace you see I just go in the left\\nhand side it's not actually deleting\\nanything so to delete it we have to\\npress X so it will start erasing stuff\\nthen you can backspace everything and\\npaste this line right here all right so\\nwe have export path is equal to\\ndouble inverted comma dollar path colon\\nslash user slash this is where we have\\nstored right slash user slasher and run\\nout slash flutter\\nslash bin all right then\\nthat's pretty much it now we can press\\nenter\\nthen we can have colon W click on enter\\nthat saves the file then we'll have\\ncolon queue a and we exert them like\\nthis\\nnow if we run the command again you'll\\nsee we have this line written right over\\nhere that's good so it has saved it\\nsuccessfully and we have successfully\\nadded it to our path as well now we need\\nto run this command so that we refresh\\nthe current window to see our you know\\nchanges if flutter command is working or\\nnot or we can just open a new terminal\\nwindow so I'm just going to close this\\nI'm going to create a new terminal and\\nthen I need to run this command to\\nverify that the flutter path\\nflutter bin directory is now in our path\\nso we can run this and we see users\\nrewind out flutter bin that's great now\\nI can clear this off now I need to\\nverify if the flutter command is working\\nor not so I'll copy this paste it over\\nhere and there we go\\nthis gives us the location of our\\nflutter folder\\nthis is where it's located right users\\nflutter bin flutter right this thing\\nright here\\nso we have successfully installed\\nflutter to our system if you're on\\nWindows\\nafter updating your path which is\\nmentioned in the documentation you\\nshould be able to run which flutter\\ncommand and see the correct output if\\nyou do that means flutter installed\\nsuccessfully now we can just run the\\nflutter doctor command which gives us a\\nlist of things now that we need to focus\\non and flutterdoctor gives me a list of\\nthings so it's kind of like a real\\ndoctor it tells you what all is not\\nthere what all is missing and this is\\nwhat you need to do so Shredder is\\ninstalled we are on 3.10.5 which is the\\nlatest version as of June 21. now the\\nnext step is to install Android related\\nstuff you can see that over here android\\nsetup\\nthen we need to work on xcode so we\\ndevelop for iOS and Mac OS\\nand after that you know we are basically\\ndone with everything Android Studio is\\nrelated to Android related stuff so\\nwe'll have all of those working so let's\\nget to the Android setup not wasting any\\nmore time and just start installing\\nAndroid Studio as well\\nso Android Studio is helping us to build\\nnative Android applications so you can\\nuse Scotland\\nor Java\\nand start preparing your apps in Android\\nStudio as well so we need to install\\nthis as well so we'll just open it in a\\nnew tab\\nand we'll click on download Android\\nStudio we have read the terms and\\nconditions and we have the Apple chip so\\nwe'll select that now we'll wait for\\nAndroid Studio to install properly and\\nafter that we need to start Android\\nStudio go through the Android setup\\nwizard\\nthis will install the latest Android SDK\\nAndroid SDK command line tools and\\nAndroid SDK build tools which are\\nrequired by flutter When developing for\\nAndroid\\nso after we do all of that we again run\\nflutterdoctor and we see if there's a\\ntick mark over here because we've\\ninstalled Android Studio so Android\\nStudio is installed successfully let's\\ndouble click on this TMG file let's\\ntransfer it to Applications\\nand Android Studio is transferred to\\napplications now we can also put this\\ninstaller in bin if you want you can\\nalso go ahead and put this in bin which\\nis another installer\\nthen we can go to Applications\\nlet's go to Android Studio double click\\nover here\\nthen it asks us if it is downloaded from\\ninternet and if we trust it so you just\\nclick on open again\\nwe are not going to import any Android\\nStudio settings so we'll just click on\\nOK\\nmaybe we can send usage statistics to\\nGoogle we can click on next\\nchoose the type of setup you want for\\nAndroid so we have not installed\\nanything earlier so we'll just go ahead\\nwith the standard one\\nwe'll click on next\\nselect the UI theme you want let's go\\nahead with docula\\nthen these are the extra things that\\nwill install emulator build tools all of\\nthat stuff we'll click on next\\nthen live sensors for everything we'll\\nclick on accept\\nwe'll come over here\\nexcept for this one as well then we'll\\nclick on finish it will start\\ndownloading the components for this so\\nall the components have now been\\ninstalled we can click on finish and we\\nhave Android studio right here\\nwe don't want to do anything with that\\nwe are just going to close it we'll\\nclose this as well now let's again run\\nflutter doctor and see if there's\\nanything we're missing now as you can\\nsee over here Android Studio is already\\ninstalled now so that was successful Now\\nAndroid related stuff two things are\\nrequired we need the command line tools\\ncomponent so for that we are again going\\nto run Android Studio\\nthen we are going to go to more actions\\nSDK manager\\nthen we are going to search for SDK\\ntools\\nthen we have Android SDK command line\\ntools right here we'll click over there\\nand then click on OK click on okay over\\nhere that will install it and we are\\ndone\\nso we can close this let's again run\\nflutterdoctor command\\nand you see that issue is resolved now\\nwe now only need to accept the Android\\nlicenses that we haven't so we can run\\nthis command and it will do that we just\\nneed to put it in the same line and run\\nit and then it works all right so\\nyeah we'll review the licenses that have\\nnot been accepted then we'll click yes\\nyes yes yes\\nand there we go so we have been accepted\\nall the licenses so I hope everything is\\nworking fine for Android now so we'll\\nrun flutter doctor and everything\\nrelated to Android is also fixed now now\\nthe last step is xcode developed for iOS\\nand Mac OS\\nso the final step that's required is for\\nxcode so we need to develop for iOS and\\nMac OS we can do that by going to the\\nApp Store and installing xcode or just\\ngo into the web download I'll go to the\\nApp Store and install it\\nso I'll wait for xcode to install and\\nthen we can focus on the stuff that's\\nmentioned later on so I'll see you when\\nxcode is installed completely on the\\nsystem all right so xcode has installed\\non our system I'll just click on open\\nhere so we like to build for Mac OS and\\niOS so I'm just going to click on\\ninstall here I'll have to enter my\\npassword and then it will start\\ninstalling additional components after\\nthat we need to configure the xcode\\ncommand lines tools to use the newly\\ninstalled version of xcode so we can\\njust copy this line\\nthen click on enter again we'll have to\\nenter a password over here and we are\\ndone then we can again run this command\\npaste it\\nso this is great I think we've\\nconfigured xcode for now\\none last command is left which is this\\npseudo xcode build license\\nwe'll\\npress space for more\\nand then we just need to type agree to\\nsay that we are agreeing and we are done\\nnow we can clear this off run flutter\\ndoctor and see if it is done properly or\\nnot\\nso one issue from xcode is gone now we\\njust need to install cocoapod which is\\nnot installed so to install it we can\\njust go to their guide the link that is\\nmentioned over here\\npaste it\\nand to install Coco pod we just need to\\nrun this command sudogem install\\ncocoapods\\nso we have installed cocoapods now we\\ncan again run the flutterdoctor command\\nand as you can see no issues found that\\nmeans the entire flutter installation is\\nsuccessful so if you've covered this\\npart and everything works fine it's all\\ngood now the last step\\nis to install vs code\\nso if you just type in vs code install\\nyou'll see this website\\ncode.visualstudio.com so this is\\nbasically our code editor this is where\\nwe are going to write our code type it\\nall out in the dart course we had used\\ndotpad.dev now we don't need to use that\\nanymore\\nwe're going to write on our system only\\nso we are going to use our PC\\nand here we have Visual Studio code that\\nwill help us to you know\\ndebug writer code it will help us and\\nbasically everything\\nso you can install it according to your\\nplatform again I'm just going to go\\nahead with the Apple silicon zip file\\nand it will start installing it for me\\nafter I have vs code installed I'll just\\nstart creating a flutter project and\\nwe'll create a first app that is the\\ncurrency converter app so vs code is now\\ninstalled you can see it and downloads\\nI'm just going to click on the small\\nsearch icon over here\\nso it shows that Visual Studio code is\\nin the download I'm just going to drag\\nthis to the applications tab because vs\\ncode is an application then double click\\non it\\nthen click on open\\nand we have vs code right here I'm going\\nto browse the color themes and select\\nwhich one I prefer I don't prefer the\\ndark high contrast it looks very weird\\nin my opinion\\nobviously not\\nlight modern color we can use this one\\nor you can go ahead look for more themes\\nso now that we have Visual Studio code\\ninstalled let's go ahead and open it so\\nI'll have Visual Studio code Type like\\nthis and open it\\nso we see a welcome tab over here we can\\nclose this welcome Tab and explore what\\nall is there in the vs code tab as of\\nnow there's no project here so it looks\\nvery empty but we'll create a flutter\\nproject open at nvs code and that will\\nlook much better but as of now let's\\njust take a look at the blank and mtvs\\ncode\\nso the first tab that we have here is\\nthe Explorer tab the Explorer tab helps\\nus to view the files\\nand the subfolders present in a folder\\nso if we have a flutter project it will\\nhave many folders and files of our\\napplication we can see all of them over\\nhere the second one is the search tab in\\nthe search tab you can find a specific\\nword\\nfrom multiple files and multiple folders\\nso if you want to search just one word\\nor just one function name you can type\\nit over here and it will output\\nall the files that contain that function\\nname\\nthen we have the source control tab\\nremember git that we installed this is\\nnot the tab we are going to look at\\nbecause that's a separate world of its\\nown\\nI'll be releasing a separate tutorial on\\nSource control with get so you don't\\nhave to worry about it for now\\nthe next one is run on debug this is a\\nplace where you can run and debug your\\napplications and the final tab we see\\nhere is the extensions tab\\nthe extensions tab allow us to add\\nadditional features to our code editor\\nso we'll be installing a bunch of\\nextensions so that our flutter code\\nlooks better and we have an increased\\nproductivity in our coding but for now\\nI'm not going to install anything I'll\\ninstall all of the extensions one by one\\nso that you see the difference\\nof using an extension and not using an\\nextension\\nthen here we have the errors and\\nwarnings tab so it tells us what errors\\nand warnings there are and when you\\nclick on it it opens a separate window\\nof its own here we see problems so it\\nwill output any problems that are\\npresent in our App application so it can\\nbe\\na warning or an error\\nso in dot pad you remember how we saw\\nwarnings that a variable was induced\\nor an error which said like when we had\\nprint statement and we put in two to\\nthree arguments it said you cannot pass\\ntwo to three arguments to a print\\nfunction all those kind of Errors can be\\nseen from here in one particular place\\nthen we have output so it will output\\nanything we want then we have debug\\nconsole so whenever you run your\\napplication all the print statements and\\neverything can be seen over here\\nhow is output different from debug\\nconsole then output will basically tell\\nyou more about the\\nproject as a whole for example\\nwhenever you add an external dependency\\nso remember in our DOT code we add but\\nan HTTP dependency\\nwhere whenever we add it to our Florida\\nproject it will show\\nall the dependencies present in our\\napplication in the output here and debug\\nconsole basically tells us what is\\nhappening when we are running the\\napplication then we have the terminal so\\nthis is an inbuilt terminal\\nthis terminal that we had right over\\nhere\\nthat is an external terminal meaning it\\nis coming from the system itself this is\\ncoming from vs code so we can eliminate\\nusing this terminal right here and we\\ncan just start using integrated terminal\\nall the time that makes sense and you\\ncan add as many terminals as you want by\\nclicking on the plus button over here\\nand delete whenever you want to delete\\nit then if you close the closed tab it\\nwill just close this window right here\\nthen you have the feedback option and\\nthe notifications tab over here so you\\ncan come back to Explorer now the next\\nstep is to create a flutter project and\\nthe first project that we are going to\\ncreate is a currency converter\\napplication\\nso to create a flutter project there are\\nagain two steps you can take you can\\nopen up your terminal from your or from\\nthe BS code terminal now to open vs\\ncodes integrated terminal you can press\\ncommand J if you're on Mac and that will\\nopen the terminal right over here okay\\nand you can again press command J to\\nhide it or you can just use the terminal\\nover here both of them work\\nNow to create a flutter project first\\nyou need to go to the folder where you\\nwant to create a flutter project I want\\nto go to the desktop folder because\\nthat's where I want to create a flutter\\nproject\\nand after that I'll run the command\\nflutter create\\nand then the name of the project which\\nis currency converter\\nso this will create a flood up project\\nby the name of currency converter and\\nthen when I click on enter\\nit creates a project please note that\\nwhen you have flutter create you need to\\nput underscore over here in case you\\nwant to\\nput a space because if you just put a\\nspace it won't be allowed it will give\\nyou an error you can try it for your own\\nand camel casing is generally not the\\nconvention to name a flood a project it\\nis generally named like this so if you\\nhave a space you just use an underscore\\njust like the Instagram usernames now we\\ncan just take this folder and drag it\\naway up and there we go we have\\neverything related to our flutter\\nproject here\\nand as you can see there are multiple\\nfolders over here you can see that in vs\\ncode as well but there are a few things\\nmore that you can see in vs code which\\nis dot dot tool\\nwhich you cannot see it over here and\\nDot idea which again you cannot see it\\nover here\\nto see it you can just press command\\nshift full stop and you'll see all the\\nhidden files over here\\nand again press command shift full stop\\nso you'll stop seeing the hidden files\\nso vs code helps us see the hidden files\\nas well now let's go over the folders\\none by one so dot tool and Dot idea is\\nnothing that we should be concerned\\nabout we should be concerned about\\nfolders starting from here so we have\\nAndroid folder so it's related to all\\nthe Android permissions that might\\nrequire\\nso whenever you have an app that wants\\nsome permission from Android related\\nstuff\\nyou'll use this folder and it basically\\nhas the entire structure of an Android\\napplication a native Android application\\nright here\\nthen we have the iOS folder\\nthis has the structure similar to an iOS\\nfolder whenever you want to give any\\nextra permission you'll have to open\\nthis iOS folder in xcode and you can\\ngive your permissions that are required\\nthen we have the lip folder the most\\nimportant folder in our flutter project\\nthis is where you're going to write all\\nyour Dart code and here we have just one\\nfile which is the main dot dot file and\\nas you can see this might look familiar\\nvoid Main\\nfunction and this has a dot dot\\nextension which basically means that\\nthis is a dart file and if this is a DOT\\nfile we already know main function is\\nwhere the application begins\\nso this is the starting point of our app\\nand\\nthe lib folder is where you're going to\\ninstall or you know add more of your\\nfiles\\nand build your entire application then\\nwe have the Linux Mac OS folder similar\\nto the Android and iOS folder if you\\nwant to give any permissions you'll give\\nthem over here for Linux and Mac OS then\\nwe add the test folder test folder is\\nrelated to the testing of our app by\\ntesting I do not mean like a normal user\\ntesting it you know when a user uses\\ntheir phone and uses the app that's not\\ncalled testing I'm talking about\\nautomated testing\\nmeaning you just write a bunch of code\\nso that you confirm that this piece of\\ncode is working\\nit won't make sense now but after you've\\nbuilt a few applications you'll\\nunderstand what I'm talking about then\\nwe have the web folder web folder\\ncontains all the assets the index.html\\nfile basically the entire web structure\\nthen we have the windows as well then we\\nhave get ignore which is related to\\nSource control so whenever you have to\\nupload to something known as GitHub\\nyou'll need this get ignore files which\\nignores all the unnecessary files in our\\nproject then we have metadata\\nand as you can see it already tells us\\nthis file tracks properties of this\\nflutter project it's nothing we should\\nbe concerned about so we can just skip\\nthis part then we have analysis options\\ndot yianl you remember the warnings and\\nerrors we used to get we can configure\\nsuch that we get more specific errors or\\nwarnings in our Florida project\\nthen we have currency converter dot IML\\nnothing we should be concerned about\\nthen we have pubspec.log and\\npubspec.yaml\\nso pubspect.yaml consists of\\nall the details of our flutter project\\nfor example the name of the project the\\ndescription of the project then this\\nline which is related to pub.dev you\\nremember the site where we went to\\ninstall HTTP plugin so if we create our\\nown dot project and we want to publish\\nit to pub.dev\\nthen we need to remove this line if we\\nare only building a flutter app\\nand that is not to be published on\\npub.dev we can keep this line\\nthat we have the version number of our\\nFlorida project or the flutter app\\nso if you have ever noticed every\\napplication has a version attached to it\\nso if you just click on an app and go to\\nits app info you'll see the version for\\nit for example the WhatsApp version as\\nof now is 2.23.11.77\\nthat's what this version number allows\\nus to do it allows us to upload to App\\nStore Play Store and all the other\\nstores without creating the confusion\\nthat two projects are similar or the\\nsame so you can have unique versions\\nevery time you upload to app store or\\nPlay Store then we have environment so\\nthis tells us the flutter SDK we'll be\\nusing in this project and\\nthe hdk we are using is basically\\ngreater than or equal to 3.0.5 but less\\nthan 4.0.0 so you can use anything from\\nflutter 3 to flutter 4 over here and it\\nwill obey all the rules you can also\\ndecrease your SDK so you can just put\\ntwo over here\\nand it can be less than three so it will\\nfollow all the rules related to flutter\\n2 to flutter 3. but obviously you need\\nto make sure that you have fluttered two\\ninstalled for that but it's always good\\nto stay on the latest SDK not on the\\nprevious SDK because you need to keep up\\nwith the advancements in your framework\\nright if we have flutter\\nwe always need to make sure that we are\\nupdated to it so that we can use all its\\nlatest features\\nthen we add the dependencies tab and in\\nthe dependency the first one we have is\\nflutter which is coming from the flutter\\nSDK itself\\nand we have the Cupertino icons the\\nCupertino icons dependency can be found\\non pub.dev\\nbut it basically allows us to use iOS\\nstyled icons Cupertino\\neverywhere in our flutter code is going\\nto relate to the iOS part so if you have\\nCupertino icons we have IOS style icons\\nthen we have Dev dependencies we already\\nknow what dependencies are\\nwe have already installed a dependency\\nnot DOT pad which was the HTTP Plugin or\\nthe HTTP package\\nin-depth dependencies we have\\ndependencies related to the developer so\\nif developer needs anything that will\\nhelp\\nthe developer to you know write code and\\nincrease productivity they can use that\\nbut it doesn't affect the user Behavior\\nat all okay so whatever you have over\\nhere is just related to the developer\\nhaving a better environment and here we\\nhave the flutter lens\\npackage and the federal lens package is\\nconnected to the analysis option.yaml\\nwhich is our linter you can see include\\npackage flutter lens flutter.aml\\nI know this might not make sense but we\\nare just starting right now as we move\\nahead you'll understand what I'm talking\\nabout\\nthen we have flutter which says users\\nmaterial design to true then you have\\nsomething related to assets we'll get\\ninto it then we have something related\\nto fonts as well we'll get into it\\nand that's pretty much all about\\npubspec.yaml\\nforeign\\ncontains all the packages that we might\\nhave installed\\nand keeps the track of the version\\nnumber the description from where it\\ncame everything\\nand at last we have the readme.md so if\\nyou want anyone to read your\\nproject and you know you have certain\\nguidelines to follow you can have a\\nreadme aware which tells everything\\nabout it and if you click on this icon\\nall of this text away or translate to\\nthis this is what dot MD represents MD\\nis short for markdown so whenever you\\nhave hashtag like this it thinks this is\\nan H1 kind of title a bigger title then\\nyou have a normal text then you have\\ntwo hashtags which is a smaller\\nheader\\nthen you have smaller text then you have\\nlinks and all of that stuff\\nso this basically allows\\nany other engineer working on your\\nproject to read more about it and you\\nknow understand how to contribute and\\nall of that stuff\\nso we can close this and we have two the\\nentire flutter project now let's go to\\nthe main.dot file which is where we are\\ngoing to be 90 of the times not in the\\nmain.file but in the lip folder in\\ngeneral we can create more dot files we\\ncan do more things and 95 percent of the\\ntimes you're just going to stay in the\\nslip folder and not move out of it\\nbecause this is where the entire flutter\\nproject is cooked\\nso yeah this is where we are main.dot\\nfile now what I want to do is there's a\\nbunch of code written here by default I\\njust want to run it but even before\\nrunning there are a few things I want to\\ndo for example you might not be able to\\nsee this font so I just want to increase\\nthe font size over here to increase it I\\nam going to press command shift p\\nsettings\\nthen click on open settings\\nclick on text editor over here\\nclick on font and here I can increase my\\nfont size so my font size can be let's\\nsay 20\\nclick on enter come over here and it\\nzoomed in a little bit too much so I\\nthink I'm going to go ahead with 18\\nthis is better but what about 17. I\\nthink 18 works well for me and I hope\\nyou're also able to see this I'm also\\ngoing to put this panel like this so\\nthat my code gets more space\\nand that looks cool now another problem\\nthat I have here is the highlighting\\npart by highlighting I mean\\nI just don't want my code Editor to look\\nblue white\\nand just orange you know I want more\\ncolors to be present if you look at take\\na look at dot pad you'll see extension\\nwhich of the keyword is in green\\nextension name is an orange color on is\\nagain a keyword so green a data type so\\nit's in white color again a data types\\nwhite color function or a variable name\\nis in blue color so I want a similar\\nkind of highlighting to be present so\\nthat it's easy for me to distinguish\\nbetween dot stuff and a lot of stuff all\\nright\\nso for that I can again press command\\nshift p\\ntype preferences and I'll find something\\nlike color theme over here I just need\\nto click it and change the theme over\\nhere so if I change the team to dark\\nPlus\\nyou see there is a colored change over\\nhere\\nnow it's not no longer just white and\\nblue it has multiple colors over here\\nblue is a keyword a class name has green\\ncolor\\nagain this is a keyword widget\\nis a class built as a function so it has\\nall of the proper\\nhighlighting that I wanted\\nnow the next step is to run the default\\ncode that is provided by flutter and\\njust take a look at how flutter looks\\nwhen it just creates a project for us\\nand we do absolutely nothing\\nso for this how can we run well we can\\njust go to the Run tab run without\\ndebugging and it tells us that we don't\\nhave an extension for debugging dot\\nshould we find a DOT extension in the\\nmarketplace you can click over here but\\nI'm just going to click on a cancel\\nbecause I know what to do\\nit's not the DOT extension that we are\\nlooking for we are looking for something\\nrelated to flutter\\nvs code tells that because we are in a\\ndart file it doesn't know that we are\\nrunning a flutter related project so we\\ndon't need to find a extension specific\\nto dot we need to find an extension\\nspecific to flutter\\nso we'll go to the extensions tab over\\nhere type flutter click on enter\\nand it gives us the extension flutter\\nwhich is provided by the dot team or the\\nGoogle team itself we can just click on\\ninstall aware\\nand what this will do is basically\\nprovide us with a set of tools which\\nwill allow us to edit refactor run and\\ndebug our applications\\nand when we install the flutter\\nextension another extension that we get\\nby default is the dart extension because\\nflutter included Dot\\nso it only makes sense to include the\\ndart extension as well\\nnow we can come over here close this\\nextension go to the main.dot file and\\nyou see we have a new bulb icon showing\\nup here then we have run debug profile\\nthree buttons right here\\non the right hand side we have devices\\nshowing up where we can select from Mac\\nOS Chrome IO simulator or pixel emulator\\nwhich is the Android emulator\\nsince we installed xcode we got access\\nto iOS simulator since we installed\\nAndroid Studio it default\\ncreated\\nthe pixel emulator if you don't see\\npixel emulator over here you can just go\\nahead and create your own Android\\nemulator all right and if you see an\\nerror like this what you need to do is\\njust go to Android studio right here\\nclick on more actions virtual device\\nmanager\\nand click on create a device select the\\nphone that you want from your let's say\\npixel 4 XL\\nor let's go ahead with pixel 6 then we\\nclick on next we'll use the API 34 the\\ndefault one if you want to change the\\nAPI so let's say you want to use\\nAndroid or Android s whatever you can\\nuse that I'm going to go ahead with the\\nAPI 34.\\nclick on next then we have pixel 6 API\\n34\\nall the default options\\nif you want you can change the Android\\nadvance settings as well where you can\\nchange the ram\\nthe virtual memory Heap the internal\\nstorage so we can change the internal\\nstorage to GB and let's say\\n550 GB\\nwhatever you want I'm just kidding you\\nknow just have 20 GB like this then\\nclick on finish and that creates an\\nemulator for you if you want to run it\\nyou can just click on this\\nlaunch icon or you can just come over\\nhere and you'll see the pixel 6 API 34\\nemulator scene over here\\nand if you want to default remove the\\ndefault pixel emulator that it created\\nfor you you can go ahead and click on\\nthese three options delete and it will\\ndelete it for you\\nso let's delete it we only want to keep\\njust one emulator over here and if we\\nagain go to the devices the device is no\\nlonger there there's just pixel 6 API\\n34.\\nso let's go ahead and run the\\nproject so where do we want to run it\\nwell we want to run it on let's say\\nChrome\\nso we'll select the Chrome device over\\nhere\\nthen we'll click on run and it will\\nstart running it for you\\nyou see there are a bunch of things that\\nhappened here it opened the debug\\nconsole so it is launching lib slash\\nmain.dot on Chrome and debug mode so\\nthis tells us a thing about flutter and\\nDot by default it goes to the lib slash\\nmain dot dot file to run the project so\\nthis is the first file to get executed\\nin after project\\nthen we have this settings thing right\\nhere it gives us a bunch of settings\\nover here for example if you want to\\npause the debugging if you want to\\nrestart your application if you want to\\nhot reload your application if you want\\nto stop it so if you stop it this thing\\nright here will get executed\\nexited so if you close this\\nyou see the web application is now gone\\nso again let's click on run and it will\\nstart running it for you and we also\\nhave this search icon which is widget\\ninspector page so if you click over here\\nit doesn't start anything right now but\\nagain if you click over here it will\\nopen the widget inspector widget\\ninspector is a kind of thing that allows\\nyou to see how your application is\\nstructured but we'll get to it later on\\nbecause you don't know what widgets are\\nright so let's close this\\nand there we go we have a floss flutter\\napp right here we have this good looking\\napp and this increment button if I click\\nover here it just increases this thing\\nright here so it's a very basic app\\nrunning on web if you want to run more\\napps you can do it simultaneously so you\\ncan open it and run it on Mac OS so\\nclick on run your run without debugging\\nwhich is another way to run your flutter\\napps you can either do it over here you\\ncan either do it over here or you can\\njust run the command flutter Run Okay so\\nthat works as well\\nso let's just click on run over here as\\nwell which opens it on Mac OS so we have\\nour application running on Chrome and\\nMac OS both\\nwe can also run three apps in one place\\nso we'll start the iOS simulator first\\nbecause\\nit's not running in the background like\\nMac OS and chrome so we'll first have to\\nstart the simulator and here we have\\niPhone 14 pro Max\\nwhich is given to us by xcode so it's\\nloading right now we can also start our\\npixel emulator so we'll just click on\\nthis\\nstart icon right here and that\\nwill launch as well and as you can see\\nthe Mac OS part is running here\\nif I just expand this\\nis our Mac OS app and this is our web\\napp both of them look very similar right\\nalmost the same\\nthat is because of flutter\\nyou can run one code base so you have\\na consistent looking UI design on both\\nyour\\nMac OS app and your Windows app and it\\nworks the same way okay nothing is\\ndifferent right here now we also have\\nour pixel emulator and iPhone radio so\\nwe can run those as well and they'll\\nwork\\nside by side as well just make sure you\\nhave the current device selected over\\nhere so that you launch it over there if\\nI want to run it on iPhone I'll just\\nclick on run run without debugging with\\niPhone selected aware if I want to run\\npixel I'll select pixel over here and\\nrun it so whatever you select over here\\nand when you click over and run over\\nhere\\nthat device will be run I hope that was\\nclear and if you click over here there\\nare four devices we are connected to and\\nrunning at the same time if you press\\ncommand J it opens the terminal you can\\ngo to the debug console\\nyou have Macos over here\\nChrome right over here\\npixel 6 loading and iPhone loading as\\nwell\\nnow I don't like running all of the\\nplatforms at the same time because\\nwe can lose out on a lot of battery very\\nquickly because we are running on four\\nplatforms together\\nwhat I like to do is run on two\\nplatforms at the most so it can be\\niPhone\\nAndroid iPhone web depending on where I\\nwant to launch it\\nso if I want to build an app only for\\nAndroid and iOS it makes sense to only\\nuse Android and iOS at the same time or\\nif you're sure that it will have a\\nconsistent UI design on both Android and\\niOS there will be no changes\\nyou can just run it on one device if you\\nwant to launch your app on all the\\ndevices\\nor on all the platforms then you can\\njust have maybe a web platform and an\\niOS simulator running\\nso it really depends on you if you want\\nyour battery to get exhausted very\\nquickly\\nyou can go ahead and run on all the four\\nplatforms there's no problem with it\\nso our iPhone process is almost done you\\ncan see xcode well done\\nand it uses the impeller run rendering\\nbackend we'll get into what impeller is\\nbut if we just come over here here is\\nour iPhone application and when we click\\nover here we are able to see the same\\nthing that we saw over here and here so\\nwe are able to run our app on all the\\nplatforms let's get done with the\\nAndroid one as well it is installing a\\nbunch of things once it completes\\ninstalling it will start running the\\napplication and then\\nwe can start designing our currency\\nconverter app from scratch and while\\nAndroid is being run let's take a look\\nat a few more things I want to get into\\nfirst one is the file explorer tab over\\nhere it looks very plain doesn't it\\nwhat I want here is certain symbols to\\nbe present so that I can distinguish\\nbetween an iOS folder or a lib folder\\nreally quickly so for that we have an\\nextension which is called vs code icons\\nthere are a bunch of vs code extensions\\nrelated to file icons\\nbut my favorite one is vs code icons\\nwhich you can click on install and it\\nwill bring icons to your file explorer\\nand here you see after you install it it\\nsaid it asks you to select a file icon\\ntheme vs code icons or city which is\\nprovided by Visual Studio code itself I\\nwant vs code icons because that's better\\nfor me\\nI'll come over here and you see all of\\nmy folders now have a unique icon to it\\nso we have Android which gives us\\nsomething similar to Android build iOS\\nso we have Apple logo\\nLinux Mac OS test\\nweb windows so everything has a\\ndifferent icon to it so I can\\ndistinguish between all of them really\\nquickly and it just helps me overall\\nalso I can see that the pixel emulator\\nis now working\\nso I can just come over here and there\\nwe go we have our app showing here as\\nwell so it looks similar on all the\\nplatforms That's The Power of using\\nflutter so now what I'm going to do is\\nexit from almost all the platforms just\\nkeep one platform on the side so that I\\nhave a perspective of what's going on so\\nI'll close Chrome I'll close Mac OS I'll\\nclose pixel as well\\nI'll just keep the iPhone on the side\\nrest all the things are now gone\\nI can also close the Android emulator if\\nI want so I'll just select this click on\\ncommand Q\\nit will save the state and close the\\npixel emulator for us awesome now we\\njust have the is simulator here and now\\nwe can start preparing our currency\\nconverter app so this is where we are\\ngoing to start writing real flutter and\\nDot code so to begin our work on the\\ncurrency converter app what I'm going to\\ndo is press command a so that I select\\neverything present in the main.dot file\\nthen I'm going to backspace everything\\nand we'll start writing everything from\\nscratch yes we are going to need a lot\\nof components that are already mentioned\\nover here these are sort of boilerplate\\ncode meaning if you don't have them your\\nflutter app won't work properly\\nso you need to have them but we'll start\\nwriting everything from scratch so that\\nwe understand why we need them in the\\nfirst place for example the stateless\\nwidget thing this material app thing all\\nof those things right so let's backspace\\nit\\nthen like every DART program we need to\\ncreate a main function because that's\\nour entry point to the DART program\\nso what happens is flutter just searches\\nfor main.dot file in lib folder when it\\ngets main.dart it searches for the main\\nfunction in the main.dot file and then\\nyou can see we get these three options\\nto run our app so now we have a simple\\ndot program with us what we need to do\\nis tell flutter to come into action and\\nstart running the app so how can we do\\nthat to do that we have a simple\\nfunction given by the flutter SDK itself\\nwhich is run up because we want to run\\nthe app right\\nso we'll pass and run up over here which\\nis a function coming from some import\\nline like this so as soon as we had run\\napp over here it automatically imported\\nthis line right here now what is this\\nline well let's break this down we have\\nimport so it's importing some package\\nsome file some\\nother project some other folder and that\\nis the flutter package\\nand in Florida package it's the\\nmaterial.dot now you might say hey this\\nline seems very similar to what we had\\nin the dart section we had import\\npackage HTTP\\nhttp.dot this was the case because we\\nwere importing\\nhttp.dot file from HTTP package we are\\ndoing the same thing over here but with\\nflutter we are importing the\\nmaterial.dot file from the flutter\\npackage if you're curious how we are\\nimporting package flutter\\nif you just go to the pubspect.aml file\\ndependencies this is where all the\\ndependencies come in\\nso anything extra your app depends on\\nthat is not related to Dot comes in over\\nhere so we have the flutter dependency\\nover here and this is coming from SDK\\nphiladel\\nunlike Cupertino underscore icons that\\nis coming from pop.dev\\nunlike the HTTP package that was coming\\nfrom pub.dev this flutter is coming from\\nthe SDK flutter\\nand what is this SDK flutter well it's\\nthe same thing that you installed on\\nyour system locally and it's good to\\nmention SDK flutter like this and not\\ngive any path to it because the path of\\nthe flutter can change\\nmaybe you reinstall it somewhere else so\\njust having SDK flutter like this is a\\nbetter thing so we can close\\npubspect.aml file and when we again come\\nover here we can see package flutter is\\nimported and from there we are importing\\nthe material.dart file why material.dot\\nfile because material.dot file gives us\\nmany of flutters functions classes\\nmethods that we can use for example the\\nrun app file or the run app function\\nbecause in Dart we don't have anything\\nlike run app\\nin Dart we have already seen we have\\nstuff like string and all of that\\nstuff like string\\ninteger Boolean async keyword all of\\nthis can be used without importing the\\nflutter library or the flutter package\\nbut stuff like run app cannot be run\\nwithout importing flutter all right\\nand to import flutter you need to have\\nflutter installed and you need to make\\nsure that in perspect.aml file you have\\nthe dependency present so again coming\\nback to run app so this import line\\nright here is quite important and you'll\\nsee later on how many times this\\nmaterial.dot is used in your flutter app\\nit's almost used in every single file\\nyou create because it also gives you\\naccess to certain widgets\\nor certain UI things which is quite\\nhelpful so now coming back to the run\\napp function what exactly is this run up\\nfunction if you just hover over this\\nyou'll see the definition of this\\nfunction it is void run app\\nand then it requires a parameter of\\nwidget app\\nso that means an app is not returning\\nanything and it requires something known\\nas widget app and since we don't know\\nwhat widget is that is not even a DOT\\nrelated thing so that means widget is\\nagain something created by flutter team\\nthemselves it's a thing in flutter so it\\nmight be a custom class that they\\ncreated but we are still not sure so to\\nunderstand this what you can do is press\\ncommand\\nso you can click on run app then\\nand when you click over here you get\\ndive\\ninto the flutter source code as you can\\nsee over here users Advance are not slot\\nup so I'm going into the flutter SDK\\nthat I installed locally on my system to\\ntake a look at this definition and\\nunderstand what this widget thing is\\nand as you can see when I go in the\\ndefinition when I hover over widget it\\nsays that it's an abstract class widget\\nand we already know what abstract\\nclasses are\\nagain if you want to take a look at the\\ndefinition of widget you can press\\ncommand again and then click on widget\\nand you'll dive into the source code of\\nabstract class widget\\nbut we are not diving into the flutter\\nsource code now\\nI just wanted to show this to you let's\\nnot make things complicated\\nso now this requires something known as\\na widget what is this widget\\nwidgets are the building blocks of the\\nuser interface they are responsible for\\ndescribing what the UI should look like\\nso let's take an example of the counter\\napp over here if I want to describe that\\nhey in my app I want the header like\\nthis\\na pink or purple kind of background with\\nsome text on it then I want some texts\\nover here then I want a button over here\\nand on that button I want this plus type\\nof icon to be displayed so all of these\\nthings are widgets because they describe\\nwhat my screen what my user interface is\\ngoing to look like\\nso that's exactly what we want to pass\\nto run app\\nand this widget can be literally\\nany UI component right so I can just put\\nin a text which is again provided by\\nflutter material.dot and you have to\\ninstantiate that text text again is a\\nclass if you press command and go to the\\ntext definition you'll see it is a class\\ntext all right and also one thing that I\\ndidn't mention please don't change\\nanything over here\\nif you change anything in the flutter\\nsource code it will behave differently\\nfor you over here and that can cause a\\nlot of problems\\nso take this as a read-only file if you\\njust want to take a look at what's going\\non inside and you're just curious in\\ngeneral\\nbut do not edit it anything at all\\nbecause if it stops\\nbehaving the way you want it to you'll\\nhave to reinstall everything and that\\ncan be quite a headache unnecessarily\\nso you can close this now\\nso now we have the text over here and\\nthat is a widget\\nso this text requires us to pass in a\\ndata as you can see whenever we\\ninstantiate a class\\nit tells us what all stuff is required\\nin this text\\nand the thing that's required over here\\nis string data and that is a positional\\nargument that's why we are getting the\\nerror over here saying one positional\\nargument expected by text Dot Nu but\\nzero found\\nwe've already seen these kind of errors\\nin the dot section\\nso let's pass a string over here\\nand let's call my text hello world so\\nthis string right here is what the text\\nshould display right if we have a\\ntexture you have pushed this button this\\nmany times that is a text right if\\nthat's a text the string data part is\\nthis thing right here so that's what\\nI've typed in over here hello world\\nthen I'll put a semicolon over here save\\nit I'll ignore the warning for now also\\nanything in blue underline is a warning\\nanything with a red underline is a\\nwarning or is an error also anything\\nwith blue underline is a warning and\\nanything with red underline is an error\\nyou can ignore warnings although you\\nshouldn't\\nbut you cannot ignore errors because if\\nthere's an error your flutter app won't\\nbuild if there's a warning your flutter\\napp can still build but it's recommended\\nto fix the warnings before moving on and\\nnow when we save it you see this thing\\nright over here\\nwe get a pop-up saying hot reload\\ncompleted what is this hot reload thing\\nhot reload is when you have a small UI\\ntweak or some small change made in your\\ncode and then when you save the file\\nyou don't have to restart your entire\\nsystem over here to see those changes\\nin hot reload you can just save your\\nfile and it will display the small UI\\ntweaks present in your code\\nso you don't have to completely restart\\nyour app and start everything from\\nscratch you can just save it\\nand you'll be able to see the small UI\\ntweak if there is no small UI tweak\\nthen you'll have to restart your app how\\ndo we restart the app by clicking over\\nhere\\non the city start button and as you can\\nsee when we restart we get\\nsome different kind of message over here\\nwith red background this is an error all\\nright\\nthe red warnings or the red underlines\\ndisplayed over here were compile time\\nerrors we've already known about that in\\nthe dot section\\nbut this ones are runtime errors\\nand you can also see runtime errors or\\ncompile time\\nerrors when you press command J\\nin the debug console and you see they've\\nmentioned the problem over here\\nnow\\nthese error messages also contain the\\nstack Trace in the terminal over here\\nyou don't see the stack Trace what is\\nstack Trace stack Trace basically allows\\nus to know where in our application the\\nerror occurred because if our\\napplication grows vast it can be a bit\\ndifficult to know hey this is where the\\nerror occurred right so stack Trace\\nalready tells us hey you have a runtime\\nerror and this is where data code so\\nthat's what text helps me with\\nand as you can see the error is the\\nrelevant error causing widget was text\\nokay so some error occurred related to\\ntext wire\\nand then you have the exception Throne\\nthis was the stack and this just goes\\ndeep into the framework telling you hey\\nthis file this file this file this file\\nis where the error occurred but we don't\\nhave to care that much about these lines\\nbecause it's related to the framework\\nand we'll anyways not be able to\\nunderstand what's going on\\nso we can just scroll up and you see the\\nfollowing assertion was thrown building\\ntext hello world so it's related to this\\nthing only\\nbut to be honest I don't understand\\nanything that's mentioned over here but\\nI do understand this thing no\\ndirectionality widget found what does\\nthis directionality widget found mean\\nit is at least legible English you know\\nbut still it's quite difficult to\\nunderstand what's directionality widget\\nwith respect to this text widget well\\nthe point over here is this text\\nrequires you to pass in\\na direction property we need to specify\\nthe direction property over here because\\nwe need to specify the text position on\\nthe screen\\ndo we want the text from to go from left\\nto right or do we want the text to go\\nfrom right to left that's what we want\\nto figure out where on the screen should\\nit be over here or over here\\nthat's why it was giving us this error\\nso let's understand how we can fix that\\nand many a times you can fix the problem\\nby looking at the properties of the\\nparticular widget or the particular text\\nclass and see if there is a property\\nrelated to direction to fix it\\nand the property is text direction right\\nand as you can see this is a named\\nargument\\nthe first thing was a positional\\nargument and after that we had named\\narguments that were optional\\nso we can pass text Direction\\nover here now you might ask if text\\ndirection is necessary without text\\nDirection it is giving us this error\\nwhy don't they make text Direction\\nproperty non-optional as well just like\\ndata right\\nif text direction is required in our\\ntext property without it it is giving us\\nan error why do we want X direction to\\nbe empty or nullable or optional the\\nreason for that is most of the times you\\nwon't be writing text widget like this\\nover here you'll be using something\\nknown as material app that we are going\\nto look into in just a moment\\nin just a while but\\nthere direction for text is already\\ndefined so you don't have to Define it\\nover there\\nso it is optional but as of now just for\\nme demoing basic flood or app to you\\nit's required\\nso for now you can blindly just put text\\nDirection it will make much more sense\\nwhen we have so as of now you can just\\nput text Direction like this\\nblindly but later on you'll understand\\nwhat I'm talking about\\nwhen we start using material app and\\nthose kind of stuff\\nso we have X Direction over here\\nand this text Direction requires text\\nDirection now is text Direction a class\\nto understand that we have to press\\ncommand and then we can go into the text\\nDirection source code but it tells\\nnothing about text Direction\\nwhy because this is the Constructor we\\nhave to go to the place where text\\ndirection is initialized so\\nwe can click over text Direction and\\nhere we are final text Direction which\\nis empty text Direction now to\\nunderstand if text direction is a class\\nor not we hover over this\\nand it tells us it's not a class it's an\\nenum\\nso text Direction can have a certain\\nlimit of values now what are those\\nvalues you can again click command so\\nyou go to the text Direction\\nenum definition and here it is\\nand it can have two values RTL or LTR\\nand as you can see it's already defined\\nover here with something known as a\\ndocumentation comment this was the third\\ntype of comment\\nin flutter we or Dot\\nin flutter or dot in the dot course we\\nsaw that there are two types of comments\\nfirst one was\\nsingle line comment another one was\\nmulti-line comment and this is a third\\ntype of comment which is the\\ndocumentation comment by documentation\\ncomment what happens is whenever I\\ninitialize text direction or use text\\nDirection and hover over it you'll see a\\ndefinition\\nor the description of this text\\nDirection property\\nand somewhere when you scroll you'll see\\nthis thing right here the text flows\\nfrom right to left example Arabic Hebrew\\nyou won't see that over here because\\nthis is present inside the enum but if\\nyou see documentation comments are\\npresent over here as well which is\\nrelated to the text Direction so if we\\njust go at the top\\nyou'll see a direction in which text\\nflows some languages are written from\\nthe left to right so if you come over\\nhere hover over this you'll see a\\ndirection in which text flows so\\nbasically with documentation comments\\nyou'll be able to see some changes over\\nhere\\nsome stuff or description written over\\nhere which is quite nice because then\\nyou don't have to Google stuff up and\\nunderstand what's required you can just\\nlook at the source code and understand\\nwhat's required\\nso let's close this let's close this and\\nlet's give text Direction up\\nvalue and that will be text Direction\\nDot and we get Auto suggestion the auto\\nsuggestion is LTR or R2L\\nand values is just a list or containing\\nRTL or LTR so I'm just going to have LTR\\nbecause I wanted to show up over here\\nleft to right so it will show up\\nsomewhere over here then I'll save it\\nbut if I come away a hot reload doesn't\\nwork because this is quite a massive\\nchange\\nso you'll have to restart your entire\\napp and then you'll be able to see Hello\\nWorld over here we are not able to see\\nit properly but yeah it is written over\\nthere\\nnow if I just mention let's say four\\nexclamation marks save it I'm not seeing\\nit again because this is a massive\\nchange\\nso after I restart I'll be able to see\\nit\\nbut later on when we start adding\\nmaterial app and we make small UI tweaks\\nyou'll be able to see the great power of\\nhot reload which is what makes flutter\\nvery different from other Frameworks\\nbecause many other Frameworks don't have\\nthe support for hot reload and it's\\nquite a wonderful feature in my opinion\\nand now if I press RTL over here instead\\nof LTR and restart the app I see text\\nover here and my exclamation marks go\\nright in the right so that was about\\ntext and you know just displaying some\\nstuff up but now let's get into\\nmore complex things because obviously we\\ndon't just want to return a text over\\nhere and\\nfor bigger apps this is not possible why\\nbecause simple apps don't just show UI\\nright they have many more things going\\non in the back end it's not about\\ndatabases of servers that I'm talking\\nabout\\nnot the back end related stuff I'm\\ntalking about stuff like\\nnavigation by navigation I mean moving\\nfrom one page to another so if I have\\none page then I want to move to another\\npage\\nbigger apps can do that for example\\nYouTube if I use youtube.com I see the\\nhome page when I click on a video I'll\\ngo to another page that contains the\\nvideo player so bigger apps have\\nmultiple pages in them and moving from\\none page to another in an app is called\\nnavigation just like moving from one\\nplace to another in real life is known\\nas navigating right so bigger apps have\\nsupport for that and it can't be done by\\njust using text we need to use something\\nelse which is known as material app or\\nit can be Cupertino app now we are going\\nto dive into both of them but before\\nthat we'll have to understand some other\\nConcepts now you know\\njust having a text widget isn't what a\\nreal app like real app will look like it\\nwill have one screen of its own and in\\nthat screen there are going to be many\\ncomponents as well for example if you\\njust open google.com it's a very simple\\nlooking page but it has a lot of\\ncomponents here first of all it has the\\nheader right up at the top Gmail images\\nall of this stuff then it has the Google\\nlogo over here then it has the text\\nfield that takes our input then it has\\ntwo buttons then it has this thing which\\nhelps us in Translation then it has\\nfooter and that too two Footers I guess\\nso it has a lot of components and in\\nflutter every component can be a widget\\nright so if you're coming from other\\nFrameworks like react you already know\\nwhat components are whatever UI building\\nblock is there and in flutter widgets\\nare components my point is that this app\\nwill grow into something big that will\\nhave many components on the screen so\\nwhat I want to do is make sure my app is\\nbroken down into several smaller widgets\\nso that more Engineers can work on it at\\nthe same time just imagine my entire app\\npresent in this function right here I\\ncan do that it's totally possible so I\\ncan build my entire app all the widgets\\nlet's say the entire Google Chrome\\nscreen I can build in this function but\\ndo you think that's feasible because it\\nis it will become such a big thing right\\nit will have like hundreds and thousands\\nof lines of code all enclosed within\\nthis function so I obviously want to\\nbreak it down so that more Engineers can\\nwork your net together\\nand when it's broken down you can allot\\ndifferent files to it different classes\\nto it and Engineers can work on net at\\nthe same time and it will boost\\nproductivity so that's what I want to do\\nI want to segregate\\nthis text widget in a widget of its own\\nthat won't have any UI change but it\\nwill definitely have a productivity\\nboost for our application\\nso let's go ahead and create our own\\ncustom widget\\nnot custom widget but our own widget and\\nwe can do that by creating a class\\nbecause widgets at the end of the day\\nare classes if you press command go to\\nthe text definition you'll see text is a\\nclass as well and it extends something\\nknown as stateless widget to become a\\nwidget\\nso we need to do the same thing\\nmy widget is going to be named as my app\\nnothing too fancy there\\nbecause if I name this as text then it\\nwill be a problem right\\nbecause then it will get confused do you\\nwant text from material.dot the thing\\nthat is coming from flutter or do you\\nwant to use your own text widget that\\nyou've created so better to just name it\\nsomething else because there are\\nhundreds of other names you can choose\\nso you can have mic app\\nextending something known as stateless\\nwidget now what is the stateless widget\\nstateless widget first of all is a type\\nof a widget and there are multiple types\\nof widgets by multiple I mean three\\nfirst one is\\nstateless widget which we have seen\\nright now the second one is a state full\\nwidget\\nand the third one is inherited widget\\nso widgets can be broadly classified in\\nthese three types\\nstateless widget and stateful widgets\\nare what we are going to discuss while\\nbuilding the first app\\nwe need to thoroughly understand this\\nthen the third one inherited widget is a\\nmore complex topic to understand so\\nwe'll be discussing it in the second and\\nthe third app all right so let's remove\\nthis for now and let's just think we\\nhave two types of widgets here\\nin terms of UI all right in terms of UI\\nrelated stuff there are only two widgets\\ninherited widget is for something else\\nso to understand stateless and stateful\\nwidget you need to understand what state\\nis all right so to understand the state\\nlet's take an example of our counter\\napplication\\nwhat will be the state over here well\\nState refers to any data that will\\ndetermine how your widget should look\\nlike how it should be rendered or how it\\nshould behave so this text over here can\\nbe\\na state the text below it the 0 is a\\nstate why because\\nthese two things are data\\nthat determine how the widget should\\nrender how it should behave how it\\nshould look like right even this app bar\\nthis button right here determine how the\\nscreen will look like but that's not the\\ndefinition of state that's the\\ndefinition of a widget\\nState refers to data that will determine\\nhow the widget should look like\\nso these two things are data that will\\ndetermine how the widget will look like\\nhow the screen will look like and app\\nbar and this button will determine how\\nthe screen will look like they are not\\nreally data right\\nso these two things are data over here\\nso that's what state is to shorten the\\ndefinition you can say state is some\\ndata that your widget will care about\\nright now what is stateless widget so it\\nis State less widget does this mean it\\ndoes not have any state at all no\\nit's very unlikely that your app does\\nnot have any state at all your app will\\nusually have States\\nthat's what gives your app meaning right\\nif I just remove the Zero from here and\\nthis you have pushed the button this\\nmany times text from here do you think\\nthis apps this app makes any sense at\\nall not really\\nso your app will have state it's very\\nunlikely that your app does not have a\\nstate\\nbut just means that your\\napp or your widget will have list State\\nand by list State I mean\\nin a stateless Widget the state is\\nimmutable the data is immutable meaning\\nonce the widget is created it cannot be\\nchanged\\nso suppose this was a stateless widget\\nit's not really a stateless widget\\nyou'll understand in a moment but if\\nthis was a stateless widget then this\\ntext wouldn't change at all this text\\nyou have pushed the button this many\\ntimes does not change at all but even\\nthe 0 would not change when I click over\\nhere all right that's what stateless\\nwould do but stateful does what happens\\nover here when I click on this button\\nthe state changes so I hope you\\nunderstood the difference between\\nstateless and stateful widget stateless\\nbasically has the state immutable so\\nthe state doesn't change at all\\nand in state full the state can change\\nit's not immutable it is mutable so\\nwhenever you want mutable state or state\\nthat can change you'll use stateful\\nwizard otherwise stateless measure\\nso for now I've extended my app with\\nstatus widget\\nbut as soon as I extend the stateless\\nwidget my app gives me an error\\nit has this red underline which tells\\nit's an error\\nand you can see the error is missing\\nconcrete implementation of stateless\\nwidget dot build\\nwhy\\nif I just remove this extent stateless\\nwidget this is a new class and that's\\nfine right but I have to extend it with\\na stateless widget so that it becomes a\\nwidget I cannot\\nnot extend it and put it in run app I\\nhave to extend it so after I extend it\\nit gives me this error meaning stateless\\nwidget\\nis telling us to override some functions\\nand we've seen that before because at\\nthe end of the day stateless widget is\\nan abstract class whenever you extend an\\nabstract class you need to override its\\nfunction and redefine its implementation\\nso what we need to do over here is add\\nup the rate override\\nwidget\\ndot build right not exactly why just go\\nto the stateless widget definition\\nscroll down and you'll find widget build\\naware this is what we need to override\\nthis is what is defined in the abstract\\ngloves now you'll ask hey\\nstateless element create element is also\\ndefined over here right but\\nthat's\\ndefined whether it's implementation\\nbecause stateless widget is extending\\nwidget\\nand widget is basically telling\\nstateless widget to override a method of\\nelement create element which is what the\\nstateless widget is doing now if you\\ndon't understand this don't worry for\\nnow you'll understand this later on when\\nwe get into widget trees elementaries\\nand render objects but for now don't\\ndon't worry about it if you don't get it\\nbut if you get it awesome\\nso basically\\nthe only thing you need to understand as\\nof now is widget build build context\\nthis thing needs to be defined so we can\\njust copy it\\nwe can paste it over here with other\\nrate override at the top then create a\\nfunction out of it but this gives us an\\nerror this gives us an error because\\nthis is a function right we need to\\nDefine its implementation now to Define\\nits implementation\\nwe have to return a widget\\nbecause this is a function this function\\ntakes a build context\\nand then we need to return a widget from\\nhere\\nso basically we need to return a widget\\nand that is why it's giving us an error\\nthe error says\\nthe body might completely normal causing\\nnull to be returned but the return type\\nwidget is a potentially non-nullable\\ntype if we had widget like this aware it\\nwould have caused no errors but\\nunfortunately or fortunately that's not\\nthe case we need to return a widget all\\nthe time from a stateless widget so we\\ncan just copy this text right at the top\\nthen return text like this and the error\\ngoes away also now we can just take this\\nmy app and put it over here\\nand make sure you have these\\nparenthesis because it's a class right\\nyou need to instantiate it\\nand now when you save it and restart\\nyour app you don't see any changes there\\nbut what happened over here is you don't\\nhave to continuously build your app\\nin this run app function you can just\\npass my app class and now you can start\\nediting in the my app class\\nthat's what I was talking about\\nby extending to a stateless widget or a\\nstateful widget you're just making sure\\nthat your app\\nis divided into smaller pieces if you\\nhave your app divided into smaller\\npieces many people can work on it\\ntogether and\\nmake more progress\\nso I hope you understood the purpose a\\nstateless widget but still we have\\nwarnings to fix we have these blue\\nunderlines to fix\\nso\\nlet's go over them one by one\\nstarting with my app now if you hover\\nover this you'll see Constructors for\\npublic widgets should have a named key\\nparameter\\nthis is basically saying that hey you\\nextended stateless widget now stateless\\nwidget you override the build function\\nthat's all good\\nnow you can create your app I won't bug\\nyou\\nwith the compile time or runtime errors\\nbut I'll still bug you with compile time\\nwarnings\\nand this warning is there because if we\\nagain go to stateless widget definition\\nyou'll see this Constructor over here\\nconstant stateless widget super dot key\\nand it did this\\nbecause it was extending widget when it\\nextended widget widget required\\nsomething known as a key for its\\nConstructor\\nright you can see it away a constant\\nwidget this dot key so our abstract\\nclass widget requires something known as\\na key\\nand whenever you extend an abstract\\nclass you'll have to pass that key to\\nthe super class which is the widget and\\nthat is what stateless widget did Super\\ndot key but where will stateless widget\\nget its key from it will get it from us\\nus the people who extend\\nstateless.widget the same thing happened\\nin text as well if you go to text\\ndefinition you'll see class text\\nextending stateless widget because text\\nalso doesn't have\\nan immutable State because if you think\\nabout it text also doesn't have a\\nmutable state obviously it will only\\nhave its own immutable State that's why\\nit's extending a stateless widget then\\nit is having\\nits key defined somewhere over here if\\nyou just search for it you'll see super\\ndot key so this is what we have to do\\nover here as well\\nwe need to create a Constructor for my\\napp\\nwhich will be something like this super\\ndot key and now the error goes away now\\nwhat is the super dot key we've already\\ndiscussed about this in the dot section\\nif you remember we had a key\\nor something like this let's say string\\ndata and then we had to give something\\nto the super class we would do\\ndata like this right what happened over\\nhere we are saying that hey you can\\noptionally pass data to us\\nand if you do pass or if you don't pass\\nwe are just going to pass that value to\\nour super class\\nwhenever we use super we refer to the\\nabstract class super right so that's\\nwhat happened over here this requires\\nkey so we have key optionally asked you\\ndon't have to necessarily specify key\\nevery time you instantiate my app\\nyou can just ask for it and if you don't\\nwant to pass that key you cannot pass in\\nand then you have to mention key over\\nhere\\nso this is what we did when we did Super\\ndot key okay\\nthis is just a shorthand syntax of this\\nlong thing right here but basically this\\nmeans we are optionally taking some\\nstuff from The Constructor\\nand passing it to the Super Widget the\\nwidget we are extending to in our case\\nthe stateless widget and in stateless\\nwidgets case widget now if you don't\\nunderstand the specifics don't worry\\nabout it you'll still be able to build\\napps without this knowledge but it's\\nbetter to have knowledge so that you can\\nbuild your apps with much more accuracy\\nand now if you see over here as soon as\\nwe add constant Constructor over here\\nmy app asks us to use constant so we\\nneed to put constant over here what is\\nthe purpose of this constant\\nthe purpose of constant is to declare\\nthat this Constructor is a compile time\\nconstant by making the Constructor\\nconstant you are just telling flood that\\nhey the widget instance that you've\\ncreated over here this my app class over\\nhere doesn't need to be recreated every\\nsingle time you can just create it once\\nand that's enough this helps to improve\\nthe performance of the app because the\\nnumber of times this object is created\\nis quite less\\nthe same thing comes away when you hover\\nover this text you'll see use const with\\nthe Constructor to improve performance\\nso again we have to use constant over\\nhere so before returning many widgets\\nyou'll have to put const before them\\nbecause it just tells that hey\\nthis widget doesn't have to be rebuilt\\nyou won't understand the purpose as of\\nnow but when we get into the\\ncurrency converter app you'll understand\\nit better which you might have in your\\nmind what is a key now key is a class\\nthat helps flutter identify and\\ndifferentiate between widgets by passing\\na key to the Constructor you explicitly\\nassign a specific key to the specific\\nwidget instance so if I pass a key to my\\napp\\nyou are assigning the key to this\\nparticular my app instance\\nand this ensures that the widget is\\nproperly managed by\\nflutter's algorithm to update the\\nwidgets whenever they update\\nnow this won't make any sense to you\\nbecause keys are used in updating the\\nwidget tree and all of those stuff but\\nyou don't even know what widget tree is\\nas of now so again this is a part that\\nwe'll cover in the widget Tree\\nElementary\\ntheory part for now let's just get the\\napp working right\\nso yeah\\nI hope you've understood it till now\\nfrom now every step we take will be\\ntowards building the currency converter\\napp so in our app right now we are just\\nreturning a text widget nothing else and\\nthat's cool but\\nhere's the problem I'm not following any\\ndesign guidelines or design rules within\\nwhich I'm restricted so I can build\\nwhatever I want so that allows me to\\nbuild really exceptional UI designs or\\nit also allows me to create most of the\\nworst UI designs now I want to make sure\\nthat doesn't happen I don't want to see\\nthe worst case scenario when I'm working\\nwith over 100 Engineers let's say so\\nwhat I want to do is make sure that my\\napp follows a particular guideline a\\ndesign system all right so for that\\nwe have two types of designs given to us\\nby two major companies now there are\\nmany more Design Systems but these are\\nthe two most popular ones first one is\\nmaterial design\\nand the second one is Cupertino design\\nso what are these designs and who made\\nthem well material design is a design\\nSystem created by Google and Cupertino\\ndesign is the design System created by\\nApple\\nnow you can think of the difference\\nbetween Now Android apps look and how\\niOS apps look and then you'll be able to\\nknow\\nthe difference between material design\\nand Cupertino design even if you scroll\\nup yours material.dot and this\\nmaterial.dart is named after this\\nmaterial design itself because\\nmaterial.dot\\nif we click on command and go over there\\ninside you'll see all of the widgets\\nhere we are going to use many of them\\nbut all of these designs are\\nrelated to material design\\nand there's a similar\\nfile in flutter related to iOS design as\\nwell so if we just have package\\nflutter slash Cupertino dot dot instead\\nof material dot you can add Cupertino\\ndesign in your app we are going to see\\nthe difference in both of them when we\\nbuild our currency converter app but as\\nof now we are just going to focus on\\nmaterial design now how do I make sure\\nmy app adds material design so for that\\nI'm going to return material apps from\\nhere as simple as that I want a material\\ndesigned app so I'll return material app\\nnow you can guess for yourself if you\\nwant Cupertino design we can just have\\nCupertino app and we'll be done and as\\nyou can see it automatically Imports\\ncupertino.dot but for now as I said we\\nare just going to focus on material app\\nat the end when we are done completing\\nthe currency converter app we are going\\nto see how this will look like in\\nCupertino design and what all stuff we\\nneed to change but as of now I'm not\\ngoing to reference Cupertino design\\nanymore we're just going to focus on\\nmaterial design\\nso coming to this material app\\nthere are lots of things we can do over\\nhere and material app just does not set\\nthe material design for our app it also\\ngives us multiple options to use or to\\nconfigure for example if you hover over\\nthis we have Navigator key scaffold\\nmessenger key home routes initial route\\non generate route and a bunch of routes\\nthen we also have theme and all the\\ntheme related stuff then we have\\nlocalization all the localization\\nrelated stuff and a lot of small small\\nthings\\nwhy I am telling you this is because\\nmaterial app allows us to\\nset up navigation for our app if we just\\nreturn a text widget we won't be able to\\nmove from one page to another without\\ndoing anything we have to return either\\na material app Cupertino app so that we\\ncan set up navigation in our app and\\nsame goes for theming same goes for\\nlocalization internationalization all of\\nthat stuff\\nnow if you're confused what theming\\ninternationalization localization\\nnavigation means we'll get to it when we\\nget to those certain topics and we dive\\ninto it as of now you can just\\nunderstand that these allows for a lot\\nof stuff which just returning a text\\ncan't do\\nokay so now I've returned a material app\\nnow what should I do if I just save it\\nand you know restart the app and come\\nover here nothing shows up\\neven my text has gone because well I had\\nreturned text from here and I removed it\\nnow what should I do to return a text\\nagain so for that\\nI can use one of the properties given by\\nmaterial app which was home so I can\\njust pass home property here and as you\\ncan see home property requires a widget\\nthat can be optional\\nso I can just pass in let's say\\na text again\\nand now I'll pass in hello world with\\nlet's say four exclamation marks save it\\nand you come over here we see hello\\nworld and now it's a different kind of\\ntext altogether\\nand you notice one thing I didn't have\\nto mention text Direction over here I\\ncould just pass in text and it worked\\nfine and I was able to see this text\\nright over here\\nwhy did that happen that happened\\nbecause material app sets up\\nthe text formatting for your app or the\\ntext design for your app if you press\\ncommand and come over here you won't be\\nable to understand where the text is\\ngiven its direction and all of that\\nstuff but you can take my word on it\\notherwise you'll have to dive deep and\\nI'm sure you won't be able to understand\\nany of this even I don't understand it\\nbut the point is how can I make this\\ntext look better because this looks\\nabsolutely terrible right what is this I\\nmean red color text with yellow\\nunderline what is that none of the\\ncurrent apps in our world use this\\nso how can I change it so to change it\\nwe have to wrap our text with something\\nknown as a scaffold\\nand usually material app\\nhome property is followed by a scaffold\\nall right so we need a scaffold over\\nhere and in this scaffold we can provide\\nthe text and we'll be able to see the\\ntext rendered properly not in a very bad\\ndesign\\nso if we put scaffold we'll discuss what\\nscaffold is\\nand in scaffold we have to provide the\\ntext widget now how can I provide the\\ntext widget well there's no home\\nproperty over here but there is a\\nproperty of body\\nand you can see Stafford provides very\\nintuitive names for everything over here\\nwe have an app bar app bar is basically\\nthe thing at the top the header then\\nthere's body so the body is the middle\\nthing\\njust similar to an HTML element right so\\nin HTML you have header header is ABBA\\nthen you have body body is this body so\\nit's kind of similar to HTML only if you\\nsee it in one way\\nso we can pass body aware then our text\\nwidget and then again we will type hello\\nworld\\nand then our for exclamation mark we'll\\nsave it and you come over here something\\nelse only shows up we have a white\\nscreen all of a sudden we have a text\\nshowing up here and it looks wonderful\\nyou know better than what we had earlier\\nhow did this happen\\nso whenever we use a scaffold\\nscaffold tells the flutter framework\\nthat hey\\nthe programmer has used a scaffold\\nwidget so we need to provide\\nuser or the programmer all the\\ncapabilities to add everything related\\nto a material design for example the\\nheader if we don't use a scaffold we\\nwon't be able to add header in any of\\nour apps material app will set the\\noverall theming and overall navigation\\nstuff for us but scaffold will make sure\\nthat something related to one specific\\npage is done and scaffold will give us\\naccess to headers Footers and all of\\nthat stuff so to make sure you\\nunderstand this material app and\\nscaffold thing let's take a look at a\\ndiagram\\nso let's say this big thing right here\\nis our material app what material app\\ndoes is set up a playground for us so\\nthat we can do everything material\\ndesign related so we have material\\ndesign over here we have all the\\nnavigation\\nlocalization internationalization\\nand theming all of them set up over here\\nso this looks after the overall app in\\ngeneral\\nso this is kind of like on a global\\nscale\\nand what scaffold will do is basically\\nin our Global space set up one local\\nspace of its own right over here and say\\nhey now you can add a header now you can\\nadd a body now you can add a footer then\\nyou can add a bunch of more stuff like\\nbottom sheets you know showing up a\\ndialog box we'll see all of that in our\\napp\\nbut that's what scaffold does scaffold\\nlooks after the\\nlocal part and material app looks after\\nthe global part and in your app you can\\nonly have one material app return right\\nit doesn't make sense to have material\\napp two or three times\\nbut scaffold it makes sense to have\\ntwo or three\\nbecause if you don't have a scaffold\\nyour text will be rendered in a very\\nand you won't like it\\nso I hope you understood the difference\\nwith this diagram and things got clearer\\nnow let's jump back into this and now\\nwhat I want to do is\\nmake sure that my text comes right in\\nthe center\\nevery time I see my text it's right in\\nthe corner who likes the text in the\\ncorner I want it right in the center\\nover here\\nhow can I do that I can do that by\\nmaking sure that text has a property of\\na center\\nis that how it works not really if you\\nlook over here you don't see anything\\nrelated to the text coming in Center yes\\nyou can use text align property which\\nbasically tells hey where do you want to\\nrender your text where do you want to\\nalign it do you want it in the left in\\nthe right in the top in the bottom but\\nthat is only when you have\\nfull access of the screen\\nright now a text widget only occupies\\nthis much space\\nit doesn't have the entire screen to\\nitself if it had the entire screen to\\nitself then it wouldn't be this small\\nright\\nif a text had access to the entire\\nscreen it would spread across the entire\\nscreen\\ntext only has access to how much space\\nit acquires over here\\nso I cannot use the text align property\\nover here and I cannot use any of text\\nproperties to do that because text\\ndoesn't have that much control\\njust think about it in terms of a\\nkingdom\\nif a certain Kingdom if our widget if\\nour text widget is a certain Kingdom if\\nour certain Kingdom wants to come over\\nhere how can they come they can only\\ncome when they have access to the entire\\narea if they don't have access to\\nanother area then they can't come over\\nhere as a result\\nthey'll only stay where they have their\\ncontrol to understand this even better\\nlet's take an analogy let's say our\\nwidget aware this text widget is a\\nkingdom if this Kingdom wants to come\\nright over here in the center how will\\nit come can the wing kingdom just come\\nanywhere they want no they have to gain\\ncontrol over this entire space so that\\nthey can come right in the center\\nwithout any control on this land or on\\nthis space no Kingdom can just move from\\nyear to year\\nso same goes for our text widget for it\\nto come over here it needs to have\\naccess to the entire space and the text\\nwidget cannot have that because it only\\ntakes as much space as it requires only\\nthis much\\nso this Kingdom can do nothing about it\\nbut yeah\\nsomething outside the kingdom can make\\nsure this kingdom comes away right so if\\nthere's another kingdom and the annex\\nthis Kingdom\\nthen they can make sure that this\\nkingdom comes right away up in the\\ncenter so that's what we want to do we\\nwant to make sure from outside that this\\ntext comes in the center because from\\ninside text does not have any power\\nso what we need to do is wrap this text\\nwith a center widget that's a widget\\nprovided to us by flutter so in body\\ninstead of having a text returned wire\\nI'm going to have Center\\nand then Center if you see there are\\nvery less properties\\nwe have key we have double width Factor\\nheight factor and a child\\nwhat I want to use is neither of these\\ntwo things and the key is generally not\\nrequired\\nso we can just have a child and a child\\nis a text widget\\nso we say hello\\nworld and then for exclamation mark save\\nit and when you come over here you see\\nhot reload Works away because this is\\nnot a very big change this is quite a\\nsmall change to the framework and as\\nsoon as I save anything\\nI don't have to restart this I can just\\npress command s it hot reloads and I see\\nthe changes in real time\\nand even our text is centered now\\nso as you can see material app\\nscaffold Center text whatever I\\nmentioned in the center\\nwill be centered the same way as\\nwhatever I mentioned in the scaffold\\nwill be scaffolded so anything you\\nmention inside of the center widget will\\nbe centered so if you want to put a\\nbutton over here you can do that if you\\nwant to put an image inside of this you\\ncan do that and it will all be centered\\nand now we have our first good looking\\nHello World app\\nnow we want to start working on the\\ncurrency converter app but before that\\nI hope you've started to realize this\\nkind of chain of\\nwidgets that we are making\\nin material art we add home then home\\nrequired a widget then scaffold body\\nbody required a widget then we add\\nCenter centers child required a wizard\\nand these are the three things all right\\nwhenever there's material app\\nthere will be home that you have to use\\nwhenever you have scaffold there will be\\nbody and whenever there's any other\\nwidget other than scaffold or material\\napp you'll have the child property on it\\nexcept a widget like text you know\\nbecause text is itself displaying\\nsomething\\nstuff like Center is not actually\\ndisplaying anything on the screen right\\nit is just setting the alignment and the\\nlayout but it's not setting\\nanything up on the screen for example\\nhello world is being displayed on the\\nscreen\\na button will be displayed on the screen\\nbut a center will not be displayed on\\nthe screen it's a way to tell the\\nflutter framework that hey\\nour programmer wants the app\\ncontent to be centered\\nso it's related to layout it's not\\nreally related to rendering anything on\\nthe screen\\nand this thing right here is also known\\nas a widget tree why\\nlet's understand that so let's say we\\nhave our material app so we have this\\ngiant block of a thing which is called\\nmaterial app so let's call this m\\nthen in material app it has something\\nknown as a scaffold then in scaffold we\\nhave a center widget and in the center\\nwidget we have\\na text widget\\nso what have we got here\\nthis is kind of like a tree right\\nbecause if you just take this and you\\nknow\\njust reverse everything up\\nmaterial app is the root of our widget\\nso material app sets the root for\\neverything\\nthat's what we saw in the previous\\ndiagram as well material art was setting\\nup everything in the global space then\\nwe add scaffold which was one of the\\nbranches then we add the center widget\\nwhich was one of the\\nbranches branches you can say sub Branch\\nthis was another sub Branch so we are\\ncreating kind of like a tree that's why\\nthis is known as a widget tree okay and\\nas I've already said before it's always\\ngood to split up your widgets so what I\\nlike to do is material app can have a\\nlot of configurations done inside it for\\nexample routing can be set up in\\nmaterial app theming can be set up in\\nmaterial app and localization\\ninternationalization and what not can be\\nset up in material app so this material\\napp can be filled pretty much so what I\\nlike to do is take this scaffold because\\nit's a separate page of its own\\nand put it in a separate file in a\\nseparate class of its own just like we\\ndid with my app when it was in Run up\\nright\\nwe just want to make sure that the\\nwidget tree always stays small so that\\nit's easier to contribute to it and it's\\neasier to understand as well\\nso what I'll do is create a separate\\nfile aware and the separate file is\\ngoing to be called let's say\\ncurrency\\nconverter\\nmaterial\\npage dot dot so you notice the\\nconvention of naming aware of currency\\nthen I wanted to put a space but if I\\nput a space it will be incorrect naming\\nso I have to put underscore over here so\\nwe have currency underscore converter\\nunderscore material underscore page dot\\ndot dot dot extension needs to be put\\notherwise vs code can't identify\\nand even flutter cannot identify that\\nthis is related to flutter so you need\\nto put the dot dot extension so vs code\\nautomatically identifies hey this is a\\nDOT file\\nokay and we have created a new file over\\nhere\\nin our lip folder itself\\nyeah\\nI can go ahead and create my stateless\\nwidget again so I'll call this class\\ncurrency converter material\\npage I've given it a pretty long name\\nyou can just call this\\nmaterial home page I am putting material\\nover here because later on in our app\\nI'm going to show you the difference\\nbetween material and Cupertino app\\nright so not to cause any confusion I'm\\nputting this as currency converter\\nmaterial page\\nhowever when we are building other apps\\nin the future I'll remove material\\nall together from my names because I\\nwon't be experimenting with two type of\\napps material and Cupertino I'm just\\ngoing to have one\\ndesign for my app which is material\\ndesign\\nbecause personally I like it much better\\nthan Cupertino design\\nso if you have just one design guideline\\nwhich is being followed then you don't\\nhave to name it like this\\nso anyways let's go ahead and extend\\nstateless widget we have already seen\\nthis\\nand it automatically Imports\\nmaterial.dot and one thing to note over\\nhere is every time you import a new DOT\\nfile you'll have to import a new\\nmaterial.dot\\nbecause these import lines are specific\\nto the file if you have import\\nmaterial.dot over here it doesn't mean\\nyou can use\\nit over here\\nall the import lines are specific to\\ntheir files now I'll have to go ahead\\nand create an at the rate override\\nwidget build then we have something\\nknown as build context which we'll\\nunderstand\\nand then I'm going to return this thing\\nright here so I can just copy this and\\ngo ahead and returns scaffold over here\\nalso I'll need to put the key over here\\nso we'll have constant currency\\nconverter material page\\nnamed argument\\nsuper dot key perfect\\nnow I can take this class\\ncome to the main.dot file remove the\\nscaffold and have\\nsomething like this done\\nso what I've done is basically\\ntransferred my entire scaffold widget\\nfrom the home over here to a particular\\nspecific widget of its own and now I can\\nkeep building the widget tree over here\\nso this thing this my app class is much\\nshorter and I can pile up all my UI\\nrelated stuff related to the currency\\nconverter page\\nin this particular widget and now if we\\nrestart the app there will be no changes\\nat all because we have basically\\ntransferred\\neverything in one class to another class\\nand then call that class so essentially\\nwe are just having material app\\nscaffold Center text the same thing but\\nin different widgets\\nit's just for our improved visual or\\nimproved working it doesn't have any\\neffect on the app till now okay\\nso I hope you've understood everything\\ntill now if you have\\namazing now again we can put Constable\\nwhenever it asks us to let's resolve all\\nthe errors we can put Constable here as\\nwell save it and this looks good\\nnow before moving forward I need you to\\nunderstand this build context thing\\nwhich is a very very important Concept\\nin flutter\\nafter widget this is the second bigger\\nconcept that I'm teaching you which is\\nbuild context so what exactly is this\\nbuild context here what does it do and\\nwhy is it mentioned inside this build\\nfunction\\nlet's understand that build context is a\\nclass provided by flutter which tells\\nthe flutter framework that hey currency\\nconverter material page is present over\\nhere in the widget tree not anywhere\\nelse it's basically telling the location\\nof this currency converter material page\\nin the entire widget tree and every time\\nyou extend a stateless widget or a\\nstateful widget you will have access to\\nbuild context and every widget has that\\nif you press command and go to the\\nscaffold definition it extends something\\nknown as a stateful widget and when we\\nscroll down\\nyou'll see that this also has a build\\ncontext\\nand same goes for the center and this\\ntext as well so every widget when\\nextended by a stateless stateful widget\\nwill have its own build context because\\nflutter wants to know its location so\\nthat's what build context does tells you\\nthe location of a particular widget in\\nthe widget tree\\nto understand this diagrammatically how\\nwill flutter know\\nmaterial app is present over here\\nscaffold is present over your Center and\\ntext are present over here\\nhow will Florida make sure that it\\ndoesn't mess up stuff it doesn't mess up\\nstuff like Center is present over here\\nand text is present over here because we\\nneed the rendering to be perfect right\\nif it is not perfect then our app will\\nlook very different from what we want it\\nto look like\\nso that's where build context helps now\\na valid question over here will be if\\nflutter can do all of this stuff behind\\nthe scenes why is this build context\\nexposed to us like why do we have access\\nto build context of air why can't which\\nit build to be like this and this will\\nbe nice right because we are not using\\nthe build context anywhere in our code\\nwell that's because we have not\\nimplemented anything that's advanced yet\\nand when we do stuff like navigation\\nmoving from one page to another setting\\nup the theme of our app all of that will\\nrequire build context\\nit is one of the most important Concepts\\nin flutter we'll understand the inner\\nworkings of how navigation will take\\nplace and all of that stuff but keep in\\nmind for now build context is basically\\ntelling the location of the widget in\\nthe widget tree also one thing that I\\nforgot to mention in the main.file if we\\ncome and you see you're in a home we\\nhave currency converter material page\\ninstantiated over here\\nbut this\\nis coming from package currency\\nconverter currency converter material\\npage dot dot so as soon as we you know\\ninstantiated it flutter automatically\\nimported this particular line\\nwhy let's break it down we have package\\ncurrency converter what is this package\\ncurrency converter well if you go to\\nyour pubspect.yaml file scroll up you'll\\nsee the name of your project as currency\\nconverter\\nover here it's package flutter because\\nthe name of the\\nflood up SDK is flutter\\nsame way our package name is currency\\nconverter that's why we have package\\ncurrency converter like this and in\\nthere we have imported the currency\\nconverter material page dot dot which is\\npresent in the lib folder it doesn't go\\nlike package currency converter slash\\nlib slash currency converter material\\npage dot dot because\\nyaml saying name it is obviously going\\nto be in the lib folder it's not going\\nto be anywhere else all your Dart files\\nare present in lib folder nowhere else\\nthat's why it directly Imports it like\\nthis however if you create a folder\\ninside of web let's say\\npages so that it's more organized right\\nand then we shift it inside click on\\nmove you can just drag and drop it and\\nthen we do move extension dot wants to\\nmake refactoring changes with this file\\nmoves basically\\nsince you've moved the file the import\\nlines will change now so Dart extension\\nwill automatically do it for us so we\\ndon't have to resolve those errors\\nnow if we click on OK you see now its\\npackage currency converter slash Pages\\nslash currency converter material page\\ndot dot\\ndot automatically did it for us and only\\nthing that we need to do is press Ctrl s\\nto save the changes made by the dot\\nextension all right so anything in the\\nlib folder will have its import like\\nthis now this is called as package\\nimporting now there's another type of\\nimporting you can use here let's remove\\nthis\\nand instead of importing it like package\\ncurrency converter what we can do is\\nrelative importing by relative importing\\nit means whatever file we are in right\\nnow in main.file\\nrelative to this main.dot file where is\\nthe file present\\nso relative to main.dot file we have dot\\nslash\\nand when you put dot slash you see auto\\nsuggestions\\nso right now we are in the lib folder\\nall right because that's where main.dot\\nis present\\nthen we need to go to the pages\\nfolder so we'll just pass in dot slash\\npages and there we have our currency\\nconverter material page so this also\\nworks and this is known as\\nrelative importing because this is an\\nimporting based on the current file so\\nif you are in main.dot file this is how\\nyou will Traverse over it all right so\\nyou can use either of them it depends on\\nyour preference and it is also based on\\nthe tools you use right many people\\nprefer importing like this but many\\npeople don't prefer importing like this\\nbut if you're coming from web\\ndevelopment you might have already seen\\nthis in JavaScript code so it shouldn't\\nbe too difficult for you however it\\nreally depends on you whatever you want\\nto do\\nalso when you remove this importing you\\nsee the error comes over here because\\nthis class is not identified this class\\nis not identified because it's coming\\nfrom some other file and we have not\\nimported that file that's why so to\\nresolve this again you can type it like\\nthis or you can just do command full\\nstop so it will give you a list of fixes\\nthat you can add in your app that will\\nfix this error so the Quick Fix is\\nimporting the library set correctly I\\nidentified that somewhere in our code\\nthis currency converter material page\\nclass is present so we can use that\\nand then it also has this different kind\\nof importing so both are importing but\\nit's just different kind of importing\\nnow we can click over here save it and\\nthen we are good to go also let's push\\nthis file out in the lip folder again\\nlet dot extension do its job we'll save\\nit and we'll delete the pages folder\\nbecause that was just for demo pages\\nwill be required later on in our apps\\nwhen we build bigger apps right now we\\njust have two three pages what do you\\nwant to do with that right so let's come\\nover here and now develop our app now\\nwhat is required in our app let's break\\nit down so how is our app going to look\\nlike well first of all we have we are\\ngoing to have a big solid texture layer\\nwhich is bolded\\nwhich says hey this is your answer all\\nright\\nso this is the converted price and then\\nwe have a simple text field which takes\\nthe user input\\nand you can type your currency\\nover here\\nand then we have a button which says\\nconvert\\nso we are going to have three elements\\nbelow one another present in our app\\nhow do we make sure that happens\\ncan we do it over here in the center\\ntext widget can we put everything in a\\ntext widget not really because there are\\nthree different things paste out\\ndifferently so we have a text showing up\\nat the top then we have a text field and\\nthen we have a button those are three\\ndifferent widgets and you can't put\\neverything in a text widget what you\\nneed to do is make sure that you have\\nsome sort of widget that will make sure\\nyou're able to align everything from top\\nto bottom\\nin a vertical manner\\nand it accepts many widgets\\nnot just a single child widget like the\\ncenter has it needs to have children\\nbecause it will take in multiple widgets\\nit will take a text widget it will take\\na text field widget and it will take\\na button so we'll remove this text from\\nhere and instead of putting a center\\naway what I'm going to do is put a\\ncolumn\\nwhat is a column column is another\\nwidget which doesn't really paint\\nanything on the screen it doesn't render\\nanything it's related to layout it's\\nbasically laying out our widgets in a\\ncertain Manner and how is it doing that\\nwell it's a column right\\nhow does column work it's something that\\ngoes from top to bottom and it has an\\nargument of children if you scroll down\\nyou'll see children and it doesn't\\naccept just a single widget it accepts a\\nlist of widgets and we already know what\\na list is\\nso let's go ahead and pass children away\\nthen we are going to have our text\\nwidget which says 0 for now okay so\\nlet's save it and where did a zero go\\nit's not showing up anywhere\\nwell that's because we have removed the\\ncenter widget from here\\nso again it starts right from the top\\ncorner and that's why zero can't be seen\\nso a simple fix to this can be wrapping\\ncolumn with Center widget again so let's\\ngo ahead and have Center\\nchild\\nthen we'll take this column and paste it\\nover here\\nsomething like this all right\\nnow if we come over here we can see our\\nzero but still it is centered\\nhorizontally it's not really centered\\nvertically it's not coming over here\\nright it's over here\\nit's centered\\nin the horizontal space not in the\\nvertical space to so to center it in the\\nvertical space column has its own\\nproperties as you can see over here it\\nhas a property of main axis alignment\\nand it also has a property of cross axis\\nalignment we do know that it's something\\nrelated to alignment that we want\\nand\\nwe have two alignment related properties\\nbut which one should we use let's\\nunderstand the name main axis alignment\\nsince this is a column what will the\\nmean axis of a column be the main axis\\nof a column is obviously the vertical\\nlandscape right this is the main\\naxis and cross axis is this thing right\\nhere\\nif we had something like a row\\nthe opposite of a column the main axis\\nof a row will be the horizontal thing\\nand the cross axis will be\\nthe vertical space but since this is a\\ncolumn\\ncolumn will have its main axis as the\\nvertical landscape or the vertical scape\\nand this will be horizontal which is\\ncross axis okay\\nso we'll go ahead and put main axis\\nalignment now what does Main axis want\\nand is it a class an enum what is it\\nso as you can see main axis alignment\\nhas a preset value so if you don't pass\\nanything to main access alignment it has\\nthe value of main access alignment dot\\nstart what do we want we want Center and\\nas you can see we have suggestions\\nrelated to it already or if you just\\npass main axis\\nalignment dot you'll still get all of\\nthose values and as we know main access\\nalignment is an enum\\nso since it's an enum we have a bunch of\\nproperties that we can select so it can\\nbe Center that's what we want\\nbut let's try other values first so that\\nwe know what we're talking about then we\\nhave end which is the opposite of start\\nright so instead of our 0 showing up\\nover here it's now showing up over here\\nif you can't see it\\nyou see this is this part here this is 0\\nthen we have space around space between\\nspace evenly start now I won't be able\\nto show you the difference between space\\naround space between space evenly as of\\nnow but when we add\\ntwo more widgets which are\\nthe text field widget and button widgets\\nwill understand the difference between\\nall of these three things so stay around\\ntill that time and we'll understand the\\ndifference but as of now we know what\\nstart is we know what end is and\\nobviously Center is basically saying hey\\ncome in the center\\nso since we've aligned this in the\\ncenter does it mean we can remove the\\ncenter widget like this and make sure\\nyour\\nremoving it nicely because when you try\\nto remove it\\nyou know you have to remove this child\\nyou have to remove the center\\nand then you also have to remove a\\nparenthesis related to it because this\\nis a center widget like this right\\nso make sure you remove it nicely or if\\nyou can't remove it nicely then press\\ncommand shift r\\nor you can just right click\\nthen go to\\nrefactor\\nthen you get a certain bunch of\\nproperties over here and you see remove\\nthis widget\\nso what this refactoring option does is\\nremove the current Widget the widget\\nthat you had right clicked on from the\\nwidget tree and when you do that\\nBoom the center widget is now gone and\\nthere's only a column and we don't even\\nget an error so you can always do that\\nif you don't feel confident in removing\\nit now if we come over here again\\nr0 is gone but where is it gone it's\\nright over here\\nwhy is it over there because we had\\nremoved the center widget which centered\\nthe column horizontally not vertically\\nvertically we add main access alignment\\nso for horizontal\\nwe have to put a center widget but\\nwhat's another thing that we can do well\\nI told you column has the cross access\\nalignment property as well which will\\nmake sure\\nits position in the horizontal space\\nso we can just go ahead and add cross\\naccess alignment then this requires\\ncross access alignment so we have cross\\naccess alignment Dot and you see we have\\na similar set of values we have Center\\nwe have end we have start and we have\\nstretch so if we put\\nand you know where it will go we know it\\nwhere it will go right so if we come\\nover here well 0 is not over here it's\\nstill over here why is that the case\\nthat's the case because column will only\\ntake up as much space as its children\\nwant\\nit will not take anything more than that\\nwhich is why so column is only taking us\\npage this much long all right it's not\\ntaking a space like this this entire\\nthing is not being taken only this much\\nis being taken\\nso that's why it cannot go over here\\nbecause column only has a space of this\\nmuch only till where the text is\\nif it had the entire space to itself\\nit could go over there\\nnow if you still don't understand what\\nI'm going to do is wrap this column with\\nsomething known as a colored box which\\nwill make sure that our column can have\\nsome color\\nbecause column doesn't have a property\\nto give itself a color to give itself a\\ncolor to give to give column a color\\nwe'll have to use a different widget we\\ncannot use column because column doesn't\\nhave a color property of its own you can\\ncheck it over here so what I'm going to\\ndo is have colored box over here which\\nis another widget provided by flutter\\nand you see we have color over here we\\nhave to pass in a color\\nand we can also take this column and\\npass it as the child so all of this is\\nvery intuitive right because colored box\\nwhat will it do well it's simple English\\nit's a box that is colored so let's put\\ncolor over here but what's color well it\\nrequires something known as a color so\\nlet's put it over here and color might\\nbe an enum but that's not the case color\\nis a class in itself and if you\\ninstantiate it\\nit will tell you to give it some value\\nwhich is an integer\\nand\\nit requires something of this sort and\\nwe really don't know what this is so we\\ncan't use this this is not for people\\nlike us so what can we use then well we\\ncan go ahead and use some of the static\\nproperties mentioned on this\\ncolor class\\nwell we can use some of the methods over\\nhere so we can use from argb from RGB of\\nalpha blend get Alpha from opacity love\\nbut what is all of this well\\nfrom argb is basically telling that\\nprovided Alpha red green blue color\\nvalues and then you'll be able to\\ndisplay it from rgbo says that give me\\nthe value of red green blue opacity and\\nthen I'll be able to display it\\nwhy does it require only red green blue\\nbecause that's the fundamental colors\\nright those are the base colors based on\\nwhich other colors are made and RGB will\\nperfectly describe any color you want to\\nmake\\nso let's go ahead and use from rgbo and\\nthen we have to provide a set of values\\nfrom 0 to 255.\\nnow we don't know any of these now what\\nis white color well we don't know\\nbut we do know how to make a red color\\nbecause red green blue is going from 0\\nto 255 so I can give red the maximum\\nvalue then we have green blue and\\nopacity so if green is 0 blue is 0 and\\nopacity is 0 will that mean I'll get a\\nred color not really because\\nopacity basically means\\nhow much part is visible and you're\\nsaying it is 0 if it is 0 visible\\nthen it is black color then there's\\nnothing there's black\\nthat's why we are going to put one over\\nhere which means it is completely\\nvisible and now you can see in a preview\\nthat we have selected the red color\\nagain if you didn't understand since red\\nis given its maximum value which is 255\\ngreen and blue are given 0 and 0 values\\nand opacity is 1\\nthat's why we get a red color now if we\\nsave it come over here\\nyou see this is what our column is it\\ndoesn't extend to the entire screen it's\\nonly this much right away here and\\nthat's why when we put cross access\\nalignment dot end\\nit doesn't go till here because column\\ndoesn't have this bigger space\\nremember what I told about text when\\ntext was over here text can only go away\\nif the text widget takes that much space\\nnow column can only take this much space\\nso it's\\nmentioned over here now in main access\\nalignment we could position it at the\\ntop in the middle in this end\\nbecause column takes that much space but\\ncolumn doesn't take the entire width\\nthat's why\\nwe cannot use cross access alignment\\nover here what we need to use is a\\ncenter widget and let's remove color\\nfrom here save it and then our widget is\\ncentered right over here perfect\\nso that's good we are able to have a\\ncolumn\\nwith r0 written right over here\\nnow the next thing I want to do is make\\nsure my zero is styled what did I say I\\nwant my text to be bolded it should be\\nbigger in size\\nso I need these two things to happen now\\nhow can I do that well we can find a\\nproperty inside of text because text\\nshould have that right\\nif a text can't style itself what can a\\ntext do and if we scroll down and find\\nsomething related to\\nbold and\\nfont size we cannot find that\\nwhy\\nbecause it is all mentioned in one\\nsingle class which is the textile class\\nso we need to mention the style property\\nput in a textile\\nwhere font size\\nfont to it all of those things are\\npresent so we can go ahead and have\\nstyle then we'll pass textile over here\\nthat's called\\nand now if you hover over textile you\\nsee a bunch of properties related to\\nstyling of the text we have color\\nwe have font size that's what we are\\nlooking for we also have background\\ncolor of the text and a lot lot more\\nthings\\nthis is why\\nall the styling related to text is\\npresent in textile since there are so\\nmany properties you cannot just put it\\nin a text widget it will be two occupied\\nover here that's why just put everything\\nin a\\ntextile class encapsulate it in text\\nstyle class and textile can be used\\ninside of the text widget\\nso that was the decision making the\\nflood attempt team took and it's clearly\\npretty good\\nso now we can put in font size over here\\nlet's say font size is 20 because this\\nrequires a value of double\\nand save it if we come over here the\\nfont size has increased but it's not\\nincreased that much so let's go ahead\\nwith 25 save it come over here and it is\\nmuch bigger still not appealing to me so\\nI'm just going to go ahead and put 35.\\nthis looks nice\\nnow you have to keep testing to see\\nwhich font size you prefer the default\\nfont size is 14 so if you put 14 where\\nit will come back to normal or if you\\ndon't mention it at all it will be 14\\nbut when you do mention it let's go\\nahead with 45 I think that would be good\\nyeah\\nand the next thing I want to do is bold\\nit so for building what can I use well\\nthere's nothing related to Bolding that\\nwe can see over here but we do have font\\nweight\\nwhat is font weight well font weight is\\nbasically how much weight the font has\\nhow much bold it is so we have found\\nweight dot boldavia fontway dot normal\\nand you see font weight requires\\nsomething known as a font to it and font\\nweight is a class with all of those\\nproperties mentioned over here\\nso we can put font to it\\ndot normal which is the default one\\nor we can use W 400 W 500 you can keep\\ntesting on your own but I'm going to go\\nahead with the Bold option because\\nthat's what I want I'll save it and you\\nsee this is bolded now if you want to\\nsee it real time I can do it over here\\nI'll remove this save it\\nthe Bold is gone now I'll put it back by\\npressing command set and save it yep now\\nit is bolded so you can see this works\\nand also if I put W 700 and save it\\nthere will be no visible difference\\nbecause behind the scenes dot bold is\\nusing W 700 weight\\nand if I put W 400\\nit will come back to normal because\\nnormal\\nis using W 400 you can see it over here\\nnow if you want something Bolder than\\nthe normal bolded you can go ahead with\\nW 800\\nor W 900 and that will keep it very\\nbolded but I'll go ahead with the\\ndefault bold option that we have and\\nthis looks better\\ngreat now if you again want to increase\\nits size you can do it depending on your\\npreference\\ngood so now we have our text displaying\\nas\\nand how we want it\\nnow again if you want to change the\\ncolor of this text you can do it so you\\ncan pass a color over here and color can\\nbe color dot from\\nargb now what is argb argb is basically\\nAlpha value\\nwhich is kind of like opacity but\\ninstead of 0 to 1 this extends from 0 to\\n255 so 255 is\\nfully visible and 0 is not visible\\nthen we have red green blue just like 0\\nto 255 0 to 255 0 to 255.\\nand also if you just go on Google and\\ntype white RGB\\nyou'll see\\nthe RGB the red green and blue values of\\nthe white color\\nso for white it's 255 255 and 255 so you\\ncan just go ahead and pass 255\\n255 255 and the alpha value is 1 so that\\nwill make\\nit white color not exactly because we\\nhave put one over here in the alpha\\nalpha requires a value of 255 and you\\nsee we get a wider value over here\\nnow if we come we are not able to see it\\nvery properly but you can see it\\nthere's a white color over here now if\\nyou're confused that why is this white\\nvisible on a white background that's\\nbecause this background color of\\nscaffold is\\nnot pure white\\nit is white but with a different RGB\\nvalue this white over here is pure white\\nthat's why we can see it and if you want\\nto change the background color of a\\nscaffold you can do it so you can come\\nto the scaffold search for a property\\nover here related to color\\nand you'll see background color over\\nhere where you can pass let's say a\\nblack color so for black you can pass in\\ncolor dot from rgbo\\nzero zero zero\\nand one why zero zero zero because when\\nred green blue r0 that means none of the\\ncolors are present that's when black\\nwill be made right black is basically\\nnothing no colors\\nand now if you see we have a black color\\nand a white colored text is visibly seen\\nover here now you might be having a\\nquestion that hey why does flutter make\\nit so complicated to just put a value to\\nput a right\\ncolor why can't I just\\nname it well you can instead of using\\nthe color class you can use the colors\\nclass\\nand then you will have access to\\na bunch of colors that you can directly\\nmention you don't have to mention there\\nrgba values\\nso if you want to put green over here\\nyou can save it then and you see this is\\ngreen color with white text and\\nobviously you need to put comma before\\nmentioning any other property otherwise\\nit will give you an error because at the\\nend of the day this is a class that is\\nbeing instantiated right and in a class\\nwhen you mention a property you need to\\nput a comma to separate it now you can\\ngo ahead and test other colors so you\\ncan have light blue and there are many\\nmany colors but the reason color dot\\nfrom RGB is present because colors dot\\ncannot mention every possible color\\nbecause there are infinite colors right\\nyou can make infinite combinations\\nnot infinite I mean uncountable\\ncombinations so to give you more access\\nto what color you want we have from argb\\nand rgbo which tell you to specify the\\ncolor on your own and\\nmake sure that your background color or\\nany color is\\nthe way you want it to be\\nso we can for now go ahead and type\\ncolors Dot\\nblue gray save it\\nand this looks fine we can keep it or we\\ncan just keep the white color\\nanything you prefer I would prefer\\nmaking the app more visual as of now\\nlater on we'll get to the minimalistic\\ndesigns all right so now we have covered\\nthe text widget as well in a column now\\ntime to put other widgets in the column\\nbefore this we have never put any other\\nwidget inside of One widget so every\\nwidget requires only one child but in\\ncolumn we have children that's why I can\\nmention\\nanother widget and what is the other\\nwidget well it's the text field widget\\nwhich will allow me to take the user\\ninput and now if I just instantiate it\\nlike this save it I get text field over\\nhere and I can type anything in this\\ntext field right but obviously this is\\nnot what our text field should look like\\nbecause text fields are meant to be more\\nvisual\\nyou know I don't know what this text\\nfield is for\\nit doesn't give me any clue as to what I\\nneed to type in over here and also the\\ndesign is looking pretty bad so let's\\nchange it by adding some designs in this\\ntext field so let's go over all the\\nstuff we need to add in the text field\\nso if we come over here the first thing\\nthat I want to add is basically kind of\\nlike a hint saying that hey this is the\\nthing you need to add it's not a\\nplaceholder but it's basically something\\nwritten over here and\\nit should show up only when I haven't\\ntyped anything over here\\nand when I start typing a number I\\nshould be seeing it so how can I make\\nsure that kind of hint comes up\\nso for that I'll have to look at the\\nproperties and see if there's a property\\nrelated to it and there's something\\nknown as style and stood style but if\\nyou see style takes up\\nvalue of textile if it takes a value of\\ntextiles then it's probably related to\\ntext and this is a text field right so\\nthis style isn't related to the style of\\nthe text feed it's related to the text\\ninside the text field\\nso if we just try to edit it out so\\nwe'll type your style text style and\\nlet's say we change the color to\\ncolors.blue all right and then we save\\nit and then if I type anything you see\\ninstead of black color I get\\nblue color so this isn't related to the\\ntext field style because this is textile\\ntextile is always related to the style\\nof the text\\nso from Context we can understand that\\nthis isn't what we want\\nalthough we can convert it to White\\nbecause the black color over here used\\nto look bad\\nthen we can go ahead and look for\\nsomething else\\nand the thing we are looking for is\\nnot mentioned anywhere over here\\nis it\\nwell it is if you see a layer we have a\\nproperty called decoration which handles\\nall the decoration related stuff in a\\ntext field and if you see it requires a\\ntype of input decoration and the default\\nvalue of it is\\ninput decoration with nothing mentioned\\ninside of it so we can just go ahead and\\nadd input decoration\\nand now input decoration has a lot of\\nconfigurations you can do why again it\\nis similar to the textile textile\\nencapsulated all the\\nproperties related to a text styling\\nwhich we can use anywhere outside of\\ntext also right so text\\nstyle could be used over your textile\\ncan be used over here as well in a text\\nfield so similarly decoration is there\\nwhere it requires input decoration and\\nwe can pass anything to an input\\ndecoration which encapsulates a lot of\\nproperties\\nthere's icon icon color label label text\\nand many more things so let's go ahead\\nwith label because this looks something\\nwe would want and this label requires a\\nwidget\\nso we can pass let's say a text saying\\nplease enter the amount in INR because I\\nam building a currency converter which\\nchanges the amount from INR to let's say\\nUSD all right or we can do the reverse\\nUSD to INR okay and now if we see over\\nhere we have everything showing up in\\nblue color\\nand when I restart the app\\nwe see please enter the amount in USD\\nover here written in black and when I\\nclick over here it goes right at the top\\nin blue color\\nit's not really legible but\\nyeah this is what label is\\nlet's go ahead and make some changes\\nfirst of all I want this to show up in\\nwhite color so what I can do is style\\ntextile then I'll pass color to it and\\nthe color will be colors dot why again\\nthen we can save it and we come over\\nhere it's now written in white color so\\nwe can see it in white color now if I\\nclick over here again this is white\\nperfect but is that what we want I don't\\nwant it to be like this for example if I\\nrestart the app\\nI don't want this label to be present\\nover here when I click over here the\\nlabel should\\nstart disappearing you know when I type\\nanything this label shouldn't be there\\nright at the top because it doesn't look\\ngood it's not a small word that can stay\\naway it's kind of like a big sentence\\nand it doesn't look good here so it's\\ndefinitely label is not what we want as\\nof now later on maybe in some part of\\nyour app you can use it but label is not\\nwhat we want over here\\nthen let's look at other properties that\\nmight help us label text here we just\\nneed to pass in a string instead of the\\nentire widget now you might ask why do\\nwe have these two different\\nproperties over here that's because\\nlabel\\nrequires a widget and you can literally\\npass any widget to it it's not\\nnecessarily a text that you need to pass\\nin it can be anything but with label\\ntext you need to pass in a string\\notherwise you don't have to pass\\nanything so that's the difference with\\nlabel you get more customizable options\\nwith label text you don't get those\\ncustomizable options however in our case\\nwe could have used label texture then we\\nhad something like this let's remove the\\ntext\\nand only a string over here and when I\\ncome\\nwe are back to normal we don't have any\\nwhite color or anything\\nso to add the white color we could go\\nahead and use label style which requires\\ntextile\\nso instead of using a text widget we use\\ntwo properties over here and it would\\nresult in the same output\\nokay then this is all floating label all\\nof that stuff basically how do you want\\nyour label to look when it's over here\\nfloating in the air right\\nthen you have helper text let's go ahead\\nand replace\\nlabel with helper text and see what it\\ndoes and here you see it says please\\nenter the amount in USD below it doesn't\\ngive me a label kind of thing and when\\nwe restart it's the same thing just\\nmentioned over here so that it could\\ngive us a\\nhint or kind of like help us to know\\nwhat is to be done over here but still\\nthis doesn't look good for our use case\\nso let's find something else then all of\\nthose to helper style related stuff is\\nthere\\nand then we have the error text so\\nwhenever you have an error related to a\\ntext field what should the error show\\nand how should it be shown\\nall of that is written over here again\\nnot what we want then we have prefix\\nicon which we'll get to after we are\\nwe've added the right text that we want\\nand the right text we are looking for is\\nhint text all right\\nI'll tell it to you right away otherwise\\nwe'll be scrolling through a bunch of\\nproperties given to us by flutter so\\nthat we have full control over the UI\\nwhich is a good thing\\nokay now let's come back here put a hand\\ntext and then we have please enter the\\namount in USD save it and we have it\\nover here\\nwhen I click\\nit doesn't go at the top it's not\\nfloating anymore it's just there and\\nwhen I start to type it disappears and\\nwhen I come back to normal when there's\\nno text again it gives us a hint of what\\nhas to be mentioned we can also\\nconfigure the Style again and then pass\\nin textile and then we need to have a\\ncolor let's say colors is colors dot why\\nsave it\\ncome back over here and this might look\\ngood or this might not let's try a\\ndifferent shade aware so we have white\\nand then a bunch of different shades\\nrelated to white white 10 white 12s why\\n24 and so on let's go ahead and drive by\\n38 save it it's kind of like gray but I\\ndon't like it that much maybe White\\nnot 12 white 60\\nI think I'll go ahead with this\\nit's not exactly White\\nso the entire focus is not over here\\nbut it does its decent job good enough\\nand now you might have noticed that when\\nI don't put commas between all of these\\nproperties the formatting of the text or\\nthe code goes wrong for example when I\\nput a comma here and Save\\nthere's a good formatting done however\\nwhen I remove the comma\\nall of these brackets come together so\\ncomma helps with indentation and\\nformatting in our code by indentation I\\nmean\\nyou see how bodies written over here\\nthen their Center then there's a gap\\nthis Gap is known as indentation\\nthis helps us to know what kind of\\nwidget tree we are in for example this\\ncolumns children all have are in the\\nsame line all right but the center\\nhas its own line over here these lines\\ncan help us to know where\\nwe are in the widget tree and that will\\nhelp us a lot\\nwhen we especially work on bigger apps\\nalso you can see these comments right\\nover here which tell you that hey this\\nis the end of the textile this is the\\nend of the input decoration this is the\\nend of text field this allows you to\\nquickly know where you are in your code\\nand add stuff quickly\\nso we have our text field over here\\nthat's good now what I want is\\nan icon over here that says you know\\na money icon kind of thing\\nso it's like a dollar that shows that\\nhey you need to enter the amount here\\nso that people who don't know English\\ncan follow along what they need to do\\nso here in our input decoration itself\\nwe have a property where that we saw\\nprefix icon right\\nso if we type prefix there are a lot of\\nprefix stuff prefix which requires a\\nwidget prefix icon which also requires a\\nwidget then prefix icon color prefix\\nicon constraints prefix style and prefix\\ntext so prefix text is you know what if\\nwe just pass string over here\\nand let's say hello\\nsave it you see prefix text is the text\\nthat shows up before\\nthe normal hint that you have and also\\nwhen you type something\\nthe prefix icon stays there but the hint\\ngoes away\\nand a cursor also starts after the\\nprefix icon or the prefix text\\nbut prefix text is not what we want what\\nwe want is prefix icon or prefix\\ntouch it\\nso we can go ahead and use prefix\\nbut here what will a prefix be I need to\\nadd an icon over here how do I add an\\nicon\\nis there a widget for it yup which is\\nicon\\nicon is another widget if you press\\ncommand you'll go in the source code\\nclass icon extends stateless widget\\nso you can add your icon over here but\\nthe icon requires a positional argument\\nof Icon data\\nwhat is this icon data well let's pass\\nit I can data and when you initialize\\nthis it asks you for some code point\\nand this code point is basically used to\\ncreate what kind of Icon you want now\\nyou can ask your AI assistant\\nto create some code point for you but we\\nare not going to do that because I\\nmyself don't understand most of the\\nstuff inside\\nof eichen data\\nlike there's font family which you can\\neasily understand font package but what\\nis code point and how do you figure it\\nout right so let's ignore that icon data\\nis not meant for people like us\\nit's for advanced developers and if you\\nwant to become one you can just go ahead\\nand Google about it\\nhowever what we can do here is pass\\nicons\\nwhy because if you click over here with\\ncommand\\nabstract final class icons can be put\\ninside of an icon widget\\nand with this icons class we have a lot\\nof material icons\\nyou can see all of them over here\\nand when you click on this Arrow right\\nhere not anywhere else just the icon\\nyou'll be able to see the icon preview\\nso we have ABC ABC outline ABC rounded\\nand a lot more stuff you can just go\\nahead and see what you want I want a\\ndollar sign is there something related\\nto a dollar sign not really so we can\\nskip this let's go back and try\\nsomething new so we have icons Dot Money\\nrelated stuff\\nyup money is there then there's money\\noff and money off is a dollar symbol\\nwith Slash on it so maybe money\\nunderscore on is there without a slash\\nsymbol but that's not the case clearly\\nso we cannot use anything like that\\nso\\nyou need to experiment over here to find\\nyour icon otherwise\\nyou can just go ahead and Google stuff\\nbut if I just do icons dot monetization\\non I see this dollar sign now if I put\\nmonetization on outline I get it just\\noutline then rounded then Sharp then\\nthere's money so let's go ahead and see\\nwhat all is there in modernization and\\nthis is all that's there so we're going\\nto go ahead and use this also put a\\ncomma so that formatting is there\\ncool so\\na comma is required\\nbefore every\\nproperty mentioned inside a class\\nbut it's not required when you have like\\nmultiple parenthesis\\ntogether okay\\nso you can have it like this but\\nobviously Comma just makes stuff better\\nand it's more readable code\\nso let's see if this come over here we\\nhave our dollar symbol showing up which\\nis nice now instead of using prefix what\\nI'll do is go ahead and use prefix icon\\nto see the difference and you see prefix\\nicon properly places it like a icon\\nbecause this\\nprefix\\nrequires a widget and you see prefix\\nicon does the proper job of putting an\\nicon before it so it leaves some margin\\nfrom here you can see there was a lot of\\nspacing added then this icon was\\nproperly placed in the text field not\\nabove or below and took the default\\ntheme of our app which was the blue\\ncolor\\nso I can obviously go ahead and change\\nthe prefix icon color this requires to\\nbe a type of color so I can just have\\ncolors dot maybe black not black let's\\ngo ahead with white again\\nyep\\nand if you want you can just make this\\noutline so you get an outline icon over\\nhere perfect and if you want to match\\nthe color present over here and color\\nfor the icon you can do that so let's\\ncopy it and paste it like this save it\\nand this looks better because both of\\nthese things are merging with each other\\nyou know\\ngood stuff now instead\\nnow what if instead of I adding my icon\\nover here I want to add it right at the\\nend what should I do then so for that we\\nhave similar properties called suffix\\nsuffix icon and all of that stuff\\nsame things so suffix will make sure\\nyour icon is over here and suffix I can\\nwill properly place it\\nthen we can put suffix I can color\\ninstead of suffix icon\\nand then you know you get the same\\nthings so instead of adding the icon in\\nthe left hand side you have the icon now\\nin the right hand side\\nso it's\\nprefix and suffix right but\\nbut in our app it doesn't make sense to\\nput the icon over here so let's shift it\\nin the left hand side\\nlet's put prefix icon here I'm just\\npressing command set to go back then I\\ncan have prefix icon and prefix icon\\ncolor this looks good\\nnow the next thing that I want is my\\ntext field to be colored\\nI don't want it to be transparent like\\nhere I want it to take a white proper\\ncolor\\nso for that I'll have to go ahead and\\nadd another property which is\\nlet's find it\\nand we see a property here which is\\nBoolean filled color filled color color\\nFocus color color hover color so let's\\ngo ahead and pass fill color and our\\ncolor is going to be colors.white let's\\nsave it and we don't see any changes\\nmaybe we need to hot restart so when we\\nhot restart we still don't see anything\\nwhy is that the case\\nwell that's case because you've\\nmentioned the fill color\\nand it says that is the base fill color\\nof the decorations container color now\\nmaybe you don't understand it but it\\nbasically is the right property to color\\nit but before fill color we need to add\\nfilled set it to true and then only we\\nsee the white background\\nright now this looks good\\ndoes it\\nbut now since we've made it white\\neverything has disappeared from here all\\nthe white 60 and all of them have gone\\nso maybe we can shift them to Black\\nso I'll change the icon and the text to\\nBlack again and we see the right thing\\nnow this looks much better however if\\nyou just zoom in or I'll just zoom in\\nfor you by taking a screenshot to take a\\nscreenshot on the screen you can press\\ncommand s\\nso you basically save the screenshot now\\nI've taken a screenshot and when I zoom\\nin you'll see there is a blue background\\nover here\\nnot a blue background you can see but a\\nblue border color\\nnow how do you remove that blue\\nbackground color and you know replace it\\nwith something you want in my case\\nI'll be happy if it is this color the\\nbackground color of the scaffold or just\\na white color so that it merges with all\\nof that stuff\\nso let's look for something border\\nrelated in our input decoration\\nand we do have a bunch of properties\\njust related to a border let's go over\\nthem so if I put in Border there's a\\nborder property\\nbut we don't have to be concerned with\\nthat I'm just going to skip that one and\\nwe are going to focus on\\nthe focused border why because Focus\\nborder is a border that displays when\\nthe input decorator has a focus and is\\nnot showing an error\\nso what is that thing well\\nright now my border or my input or my\\ntext field is not focused when I click\\nover here there is a blue border that\\nshows up correct\\nthat is focused border so I just need to\\nuse that so I can just have focused\\nborder\\nand then I can pass an outline input\\nborder then I can just pass an input\\nborder the thing that it requires so\\nI'll just go ahead and pass it in over\\nhere but as you can see it gives me an\\nerror saying abstract classes cannot be\\ninstantiated try creating an instance of\\na concrete subtype basically input\\nborder is an abstract class\\nso I cannot use that\\nso let's remove that and find a class\\nthat basically inherits from input\\nborder so basically extending from input\\nborder so you need can type input border\\nand we do see two type of classes here\\noutline input border and underline input\\nborder let's go ahead and use outline\\ninput border first then save it\\nand now if you see the color of when it\\nis in Focus has changed it has changed a\\nlittle bit right\\nif I just restart the app again I click\\nover here you see it kind of enlarges\\nand then there's a thick black border\\nshowing instead of a blue border why\\nlet's take a look at the properties of\\noutline input body to understand that\\nthere's Border Side border radius and\\nGAP padding let's take a look at Border\\nSide so if I pass in Border Side\\nit requires a type of Border Side so I\\ncan just go ahead and use Border Side\\nand when I go overboard aside this class\\nhas its own bunch of properties it has\\ncolor width style and stroke align so\\nthe first one is color which has\\nconstant color of 0 xff and six zeros\\nso how do we understand what color this\\nis\\nto understand that let's understand the\\nformat the colors are in\\nso every color in\\nflutter\\nhas a type which is like 0x\\naarr GG BB so first you need to mention\\n0x then you need to mention that Alpha\\nvalues\\nthen the red value then the green value\\nthen the blue value\\nso here we have\\n0 x f f zero zero zero zero zero so\\nthat's 0x then Alpha is FF then we have\\ntwo values for r two numbers for G and\\ntwo numbers for B that means\\nwe have RGB of 0 0 0 that means we have\\na black color and that is why we have a\\nblack color showing up over here since\\nthe default color of\\nthe Border Side is 0x and when we first\\ncreate an\\noutline input border by default it\\ncreates a Border Side instance that is\\nwhy\\nthe color is default by black but we can\\nchange it so let's go ahead and change\\nit we have colors dot let's say\\nWhite\\nor colors.red let's go ahead with\\ncolors.red\\nthen we come over here and there's a red\\ncolor showing up now the red color is\\nquite small right so I can increase its\\nwidth so I can pass the width as let's\\nsay 10.0 come over here and here it is a\\nmassive width over here\\nnow I don't want that much let's put it\\nout to\\nand this looks better\\nthen we have style so what style of the\\nBorder do you want\\nand this requires a type of Border style\\nso you can have border style dot none or\\nsolid\\nso let's have border style dot none\\nand then there is no border at all\\nbut if I put solid it puts a solid thick\\nline here\\nand then there's stroke align which has\\na value of stroke align inside\\nso we have stroke align but stroke align\\nrequires a double value how can you pass\\nin stroke a line inside well that's\\nbecause stroke\\na line inside is a property mentioned\\ninside of Border Side itself so we have\\nBorder Side Dot strokaline Center border\\nsites dot stroke align inside and Border\\nSide dot stroke align outside\\nthat is why in stroke align you see\\nstroke align inside however when you\\njump inside here\\nstroke align inside is a value\\nstroke align Center is also a value and\\nstroker line outside is also a value\\nthis is negative one this is 0 and this\\nis one displaying where you want it do\\nyou want the border to be inside in the\\ncenter or outside\\nlet's take a screenshot of this emulator\\nto understand it better to take a\\nscreenshot you just have to press\\ncommand s and that will take it\\nand then when you scroll inside you'll\\nsee that this is the part where\\nour text field is ending and our border\\nis displaying inside if I want it right\\nin the center or outside where the text\\nfield\\ngets over I can do that\\nso I can just have Border Side Dot\\nstroke align inside stroker line outside\\nlet's put stroker line outside\\nand you see the difference\\nnow it is at the outside it doesn't feel\\ninside now this is a very minor change\\nbut it does affect the UI a little bit\\nlet's put some commas and there we go\\nnow I'm just going to remove red because\\nred doesn't look good I'll just put\\nblack because black looks solid\\nand now let's exit this because I wanted\\nit outside and that's good\\nor maybe we don't want it outside we can\\nkeep it inside perfect now the next\\nthing is whenever I type something it\\nshows up in white color so I need to\\nchange it to Black again so I can just\\nhave the\\nstyle over here the text style which is\\nrelated to what the user enters to\\ncolors.black and now when I type\\nanything it looks good perfect the next\\nthing that you might want in your text\\nfield input is\\nthis thing right here is slightly curved\\nyou want it completely curved like it\\nshouldn't look very rectangle it should\\nlook something like this right so if you\\nwant that kind of text field you can\\nchange that by editing one property\\nwhich is the Border radius so you can\\npass border radius over here and Border\\nradius requires a type of Border radius\\nso you can have border\\nradius\\nbut if you do this much it's not allowed\\nbecause border radius if you go over\\nthere doesn't allow you to go\\nbecause border radius has a Constructor\\nthat is private however when I remove\\nthe instantiation I only have a type of\\nBorder radius so I can click and go over\\nthere but if you see border radius\\nConstructor is not present at all a\\nclass of water radius is present but\\nthere's nothing related to Bod radius\\nConstructor also you'll see some new\\nstuff over here you have border radius\\ndot all\\nand that is not a static method why\\nbecause it's named after border radius\\nand Border radius is\\nthe name of the class so that means it\\nis a Constructor and this is a named\\nConstructor not the named argument\\nConstructor but the Constructor has its\\nown name that you can use\\nso we are going to use exactly that we\\nare going to have border radius Dot and\\nit has a lot of stuff 0 which basically\\neliminates the entire border radius now\\nyou see the curve is gone it is a\\nperfect rectangle but that's not what we\\nwant we want border radius dot all so in\\nall the directions of your text field\\nwhat border radius you need to put in\\nhorizontal so from the left hand the\\nright side what you want only so from\\ntop left side from top right side\\nwhat you want\\nso horizontal basically allows you to\\nhave a little bit more customization\\nthan all and only has full control over\\nyour entire text field\\nthen you have vertical so you have top\\nand bottom circular so you want to\\ncreate a border radius where everything\\nlooks circular\\nand then you have look which is linearly\\ninterpolating between two border radius\\nobjects but you don't need to care about\\nit that much\\nyou can get most of your stuff done with\\nthese five things\\nlet's go ahead and try border radius dot\\nall 10 and then save it but if we do\\nthis we get an error why because this\\nrequires a type of radius not an integer\\nso we need to remove this and pass\\nradius\\nand it's a positional argument so you\\ncan just pass in radius\\nand again radius Constructor is not\\ndefined you have to use radius dot\\nsomething\\nso always whenever you want to figure\\nsomething out because obviously you'll\\nfind out later on that there are so many\\nwidgets you won't know everything about\\nthem but you can always know what all\\nproperties they need and it's in very\\nEnglish language there's nothing\\nvery UI related language that's\\nmentioned over here that you can't\\nunderstand so you can just figure out by\\ndoing this radius but it doesn't\\nresolve the error because its\\nConstructor doesn't exist so let's try\\nto do something with radius Dot\\nand yeah we do get options for that and\\nyou see here we have image descriptions\\nfor it\\nwhat is circular what is elliptical what\\nis love but we are just going to go\\nahead with radius dot circular and pass\\nin 10 which is what circular requires a\\nDouble Radius value\\nthen save it\\nbecome aware and this is more rounded\\nbut we can make it more rounded by\\nhaving 40 and you see this is proper\\ninput that one might require\\nthen we can also pass in 60\\nand this\\nmakes it even more circular\\nso you get the point now let's try\\nsomething else we have border radius Dot\\nhorizontal and from the left side we are\\ngoing to have radius dot circular 60\\nokay let's see what happens you see\\nfrom the left hand side there is this\\nradius but on the right hand side it's\\nstrictly edgy\\nand if we do it for right we have right\\ndot circular like this so this is pointy\\na perfect rectangle and then we have\\nCircle over here\\nso you can create a bunch of things like\\nthis with horizontal with vertical in\\nvertical you have to mention top or\\nbottom you can pass in top\\nand it's something like this then you\\nhave bottom\\nwhere you have something like this so\\nyou can try a lot of stuff and maybe it\\nlooks cool sometime maybe it doesn't but\\nI'm just going to go ahead\\nwith\\nborder radius.all because\\nthat's better in my opinion a standard\\nway now you can also try to put\\nonly here and go ahead and configure\\neverything from top left top right and\\neverything but you get the point I'm not\\ngoing to dive much into this now\\nand now finally if we try circular\\ncircular gives us an error because\\ncircular doesn't require radius it\\nrequires a double value\\nso let's remove this and put 60. is that\\nfine\\nnot really it's giving us an error why\\nwe have put a double value right\\nwell that's because if we go to the\\ncircular part\\nevery Constructor here has a const\\nconstant border radius dot all constant\\nborder radius dot vertical constant\\nborder radius dot horizontal but\\nit's not border radius dot circular with\\na constant it's just border radius dot\\ncircular\\nthat's why this isn't a constant\\nConstructor\\nand right at the top we have mentioned\\nreturn constant scaffold since we have\\nreturned constant scaffold all of its\\nwidgets need to be constant like Center\\nwas a constant and column was a constant\\nand likewise even text and textile text\\nfield textile everything was a constant\\nbut finally we have something which is\\nnot a constant\\nso what do we need to do we just need to\\nremove a constant scaffold from here\\nput a constant text put constant textile\\nput constant textile over here put\\nconstant Border Side and that's all\\nour error gets fixed and we need to put\\nconstant for every single widget which\\nis a const\\nbut since this wasn't a const\\nWe cannot put constant over here or on\\nany widget here if we put constant aware\\nthat won't be allowed\\nWe cannot put constant on any parent\\nwidget\\nfor Border radius the parent widget will\\nbe Border Side outline input border not\\nborder side only out or outline input\\nborder\\ninput decoration\\ntext field\\ncolumn Center and scaffold\\nso you can't put constant on any of its\\nparents widget\\nparent widget\\nis whatever widget border radius is in\\nand it's in\\noutline input border input decoration\\ntext field and stuff like that okay\\nso I hope you understood that we are\\ngoing to know more about constant and\\nwhy it's required after we have built a\\nsuccessfully working application\\nbut for now just follow along and use\\nconstant every time\\nnow if we come over here\\nit's the same output border radius dot\\ncircular 60 has the same output as\\nborders hook radius dot all\\nradius dot circular\\n60. all right\\nbecause at the end of the day we are\\njust saying\\nfrom all the edges you want to put\\na radius that is circular which is 60\\nand Border radius dot circular also says\\nthat from all the edges you want to put\\ncircular\\nwhich is 60. okay so it's the same thing\\nhowever I don't want any of that\\nor maybe I do want border radius dot\\nCircle let's say n\\nor maybe\\n5\\nand that will be good enough for me and\\nwe are pretty much done with everything\\nbut if you see one thing when we restart\\nour app we have our text field looking a\\nbit weird and when we click over it it\\nenlarges and it just feels very weird\\nyou know so what I want to do is make\\nour text field look like this from the\\nstart okay when I click over here when I\\nhave the focus\\nand when I don't have the focus it\\nshould look the same thing so for that\\nwe have a different border property\\nwhich is\\nenabled border\\nwhen I put enabled border it also\\nrequires the same thing input border\\nand since input border is an abstract\\nclass I cannot use it but I can use\\nunderline input or outline input what is\\nunderline input underlined input if we\\njust instantiated and restart our app we\\ncan't see anything visible but if we\\ntake a screenshot come aware and zoom in\\nyou'll see there's a border only in the\\nbottom there's no border at the top\\nthere's a border only in the bottom\\nwhich is black which is what underline\\ninput border is instead of having\\nborders everywhere like you have an\\noutline input border you just have an\\nunderline border\\nand then you have board properties\\nrelated to it which is Border Side which\\nwe've already looked at over here\\nthen it has border radius\\nwhich we already saw and that's it no\\nfurther customization so that's not what\\nwe want what we want is this outline\\ninput border so I can just grab this\\npress command C to copy it and paste it\\nover here also put a comma so that\\nformatting works and when we come over\\nhere you see when I click over here and\\nwhen I don't collect it's the same thing\\nbut yeah this makes my widget look very\\nbig so what I can do instead is\\nin my build function itself I'll create\\nfinal\\nborder\\nwhich is equal to\\nthis outline input border that I just\\nsaved\\nso at the end of the day this is a\\nfunction right and in a function I can\\ncreate my own variable which I've\\ncreated over here I've created a border\\nvariable and assigned it a value of\\noutline input border if I hover over it\\ndot currently correctly recognizes it\\nnow I can take this border and paste it\\nover here\\nI can take this border and paste it over\\nhere\\nwhat this does is reduce the complexity\\ninside my input decoration\\nbecause I'm not writing big big stuff\\nhere which are the same thing and also\\nwhenever I want to change anything I can\\ndo it one place if I had two different\\ninstances over here and maybe I wanted\\nmy border style to have a width of 10\\nthen it would be weird why because right\\nnow it looks normal when I click over it\\nit looks very weird\\nbecause I changed the stuff\\nin my focus border but I didn't change\\nit in the enabled border I also need to\\nchange it over here right and then when\\nI start it it feels the same thing\\nso what I've done instead is\\ncreated a variable border here then took\\nthis border\\npasted it over here pasted it over here\\nand then whenever I want to change\\nsomething I can just do it at one place\\nand it correctly changes right\\nso I hope you understood that and this\\nis a build function this is a function\\nwhere I can create any variable that I\\nwant and I've created it over here I can\\nalso create it over here in my class but\\nit has some problems\\nbecause this is a cons Constructor I've\\nused body radius dot circular\\nso I'll have to remove constant from\\nhere for it to work\\nand we've already seen that const has\\nperformance benefits\\nso you should not remove it from The\\nConstructor of a widget at least as much\\nas you can\\nand we can avoid it by putting this in\\nthe build function so why not but yeah\\none thing to note is don't put\\nany complex task inside of this build\\nfunction yeah you can put variables and\\nyou can put functions that are not\\nexpensive that means that they are not\\ndoing big big stuff like putting an\\nasynchronous thing over here or putting\\na timer\\nnothing like that needs to be done in\\nbuild function build function should\\nhave\\na widget tree that is to be returned and\\nmaybe if you want you can put\\nvariables over here\\nokay perfect so my text field looks good\\nokay let me change my width back to\\n2.0\\nyeah so we are done with the text field\\nand we have taken a look at a lot of\\ntext Field properties there are still a\\nlot more that we can cover\\nbut\\nlet's not get into them so the design\\nfor the text field looks good enough I\\nthink we can exit from here\\nbut there's still two more things that I\\nwant to fix first one is this text field\\nbeing too much in the corners all right\\nI want some spacing to be there from\\nhere from here all right from the left\\nand the right hand side and another\\nthing is when I press command K while\\nbeing on the text field\\nwe get our\\nkeyboard here\\nokay when I press command key I get\\naccess to the keyboard\\nif you're on Android emulator\\nkeyboard is constantly there on the\\nAndroid emulator\\nyou see our keyboard allows us to put\\ntext related stuff here I don't want\\nthat I want to restrict it to numbers\\nonly you shouldn't be seeing text\\nyou should only be seeing\\nnumbers here\\nso let's go ahead and put\\na property that will make sure\\ntext field doesn't allow you to put\\ntext\\nonly numbers\\nso that property is not mentioned in\\ninput decoration input decoration is\\nrelated to how you want to design and\\ndecorate your text field but this is not\\nrelated to designing the text field it's\\nrelated to one of the properties or\\nfunctionalities of text field so we can\\nclick over here\\nforeign\\ntype we want to change the keyboard only\\nright so we have keyboard type here\\nwhich we can change so let's go out of\\nthe input decoration\\nand pass in keyboard type and this\\nrequires a type of text input type so we\\ncan go ahead and mention text input type\\nDot and this is an e and this is a class\\nthat allows us to put multiple things so\\nwe have text input type dot date time so\\nif you only want date related stuff\\nand you can see on iOS it requests the\\ndefault keyboard but on Android it\\nrequests a keyboard with ready access to\\nthis because iOS doesn't have an Android\\nstyle keyboard and iOS doesn't have and\\nAndroid doesn't have IOS style keyboard\\nobviously so let's go ahead and see what\\nwe want we want number so we can have\\nnumber and\\nwe restarted\\nwe click over here and we see only\\nnumbers that's good right\\nhowever the problem over here is yeah I\\ncannot put\\ntext but I cannot also put decimal\\npoints I want decimal points so let's\\nfind something else so we love\\nnumber phone street address but we also\\nhave number with options so this allows\\nus to put a decimal point\\nif I save this much and restart the app\\ncome over here\\nno changes however\\nI do have two named properties that I\\ncan configure decimal and signed if I\\nput decimal\\nset it to True save it\\nagain we need to restart\\ncome aware\\nwe have a nice decimal point showing up\\nover here 8.0\\nand if you want you can also set signed\\nto True which allows you to put negative\\nsign again we'll have to restart\\ncome aware\\nand you see\\nwe get all of those stuff\\nso basically we get all the alphabets\\nand everything but our keyboard starts\\nwith showing a number\\nbut that's not what I want so I'll just\\nset decimal to true and set this as\\nconstant because this has a constant\\nConstructor\\nso yeah\\nlet's restart the app and there we go\\nperfect\\nnow\\nthe second thing that I wanted is the\\npadding over here or the margin to be\\nleft from the left side and the right\\nhand side some spacing needs to be there\\nbut I cannot do that by using one of the\\nproperties of text field why because\\ntext field doesn't have those properties\\nit doesn't have anything related to\\nmargin padding all of that stuff but\\nthat's not the case it does have\\nsomething related to padding which is\\nscroll padding and if we see in\\ndecoration because\\nwe are decorating the text field only we\\nhave content padding but those are\\ntwo things that are related with inside\\nof the text field with content batting\\nbasically you can set padding\\nsuch that you can leave space from here\\nyou can make sure that your text field\\nlooks bigger and this text has\\nmore padding to it\\nso this text field will appear stretched\\nbut that's not what we want\\nand the scroll padding is nowhere\\nrelated to what we want\\nit configures a padding to edges\\nsurrounding a scroll level when the text\\nfield Scrolls into view nothing that we\\ncare about so we can exit this so text\\nfield is not giving us any property and\\nrightly so how can text field give us a\\nproperty related to the outside\\nfor that we'll again have to wrap our\\ntext field with other widget\\nand what is that widget well it can be\\npadding or container widget\\nlet's take a look at both of those\\nwidget padding\\nand container\\nso I'm just going to wrap my text field\\nwith the padding widget and for that I\\ndon't have to write padding and all of\\nthat stuff what I can do is press Ctrl\\nshift r\\nwhich brings up a set of\\nrefactoring options or you can just\\npress\\nright click refactor and then you have\\naccess to the refactoring option and\\nhere you can wrap with the widget you\\ncan wrap with a builder other widgets\\nthat are present\\nand then you also have container and\\npadding so let's wrap it with padding\\nand you see there's padding then the\\npadding property and then a child so it\\ncorrectly configures itself so we don't\\nhave to do much task with it then we\\nsave it\\nand then there's padding\\nso what's happening over here is this\\ntext field text field usually takes up\\nthe entire width of the device or the\\nentire width that it's given\\nbut here you are restricting it to take\\nthe entire width that is\\nprovided by adding padding and padding\\nis the amount of space by which to\\ninsert the child\\nso basically\\ntext field has a habit of taking the\\nentire screen you're saying that hey you\\ncannot take the entire screen\\nand you're restricting it\\nby putting a padding widget which\\neliminates 8 pixels of screen size and\\nalso padding requires something known as\\nagencies geometry but if you just do\\nEdge in sets geometry\\nit won't allow you because\\nit is an abstract class\\nbut Edge in such\\nextends its agent's geometry so you can\\nuse it over here now you see how the\\nentire flood of framework is built on\\nthe concept of inheritance encapsulation\\nall the object oriented programming\\nConcepts that we learned about\\nbut anyways this is good and I think\\nthis is a nice start\\nagencies dot all eight is quite good\\nover here and it looks good however\\nthere are more properties on edge\\ninstance that you can take a look at\\nagentsets dot all agencies Dot from ltrb\\nwhich is from left top right bottom\\nthen you need to mention all of those\\nthings then you have Dot from view\\npadding so you can set a padding based\\non The View padding then we have only so\\nyou can set left upright bottom\\nnow you might ask what's the difference\\nbetween from ltrb and only well the\\ndifference is all the properties inside\\nof only are optional\\nyou can pass them and you cannot pass\\nthem it's fine if you only want to pass\\nleft you can pass it and you'll be good\\nright\\nbut on the other hand when you have from\\nltrb you necessarily need to mention all\\nof those parameters you need to mention\\nleft top right bottom values you cannot\\nskip any one of them\\nor you can just pass in zero but yeah\\nthis is just more customization added\\nfor you but we are just going to go\\nahead with only\\nnot all why not all\\nbecause when we leave live with all you\\nlive by leave padding from your from\\nYear from year and from bottom as well\\nwhen we add a button you'll see that\\nbut with\\nonly\\nalready\\nsymmetric where you need to mention the\\nhorizontal and vertical values\\nyou can leave spacing from year and year\\nor from year and year\\nso you need to set for vertical together\\nand from horizontal together that means\\nif I pass in horizontal 10 and save it\\nfrom left I'm leaving 10 pixels from\\nright I'm leaving 10 pixels\\nbut from top and bottom I'm leaving 0\\npixel that's how it works and I think\\nyou're smart enough to figure it out on\\nyour own\\nwe are going to go ahead with let's say\\nagencies dot all 10\\nbecause\\nwe need to leave some space from here\\nand we need to leave space from below\\nwhen our button comes along\\ngreat this looks good\\nnow instead of using padding you can\\nalso use container so if I use container\\ninstead of padding\\nit all works fine why because container\\nallows you to set a bunch of properties\\nit has alignment padding color\\ndecoration width height so it's like a\\none and all widget right\\nit allows you to set multiple properties\\nand if you just\\ncommand click on container and just go\\nto its build function\\nyou'll notice that\\ncontainer is itself made up of multiple\\nother widgets like you might have seen\\nthe agent says geometry the padding\\nwidget so whenever we set the padding\\nover here in our container you're\\nbasically using the padding widget only\\nthen we have the color where we are\\nusing colored box\\nand when you see margin\\nor constraints it is using a bunch of\\nother widgets is what I'm saying\\nnow here you can set padding or margin\\nnow what is the difference between\\npadding and margin\\nto understand that let's take a look at\\nthe diagram\\nif I just remove this\\nwill be able to draw something so let's\\nsay we have a screen like this maybe a\\nbetter screen okay\\nnow\\nthis is where my app resides\\nso this is my text that is displaying\\nokay\\nso I have my text over here\\nnow the spacing between the\\ntext and this container box is known as\\npadding all right\\nthis thing right here is padding but\\nthis thing right here is margin\\nso to explain it in a short sentence\\nmargin is related to stuff outside your\\ncontainer\\nand padding is related to stuff inside\\nyour container\\nbut in this case the padding and margin\\nwill be the same thing so if we save it\\nour text field decreases even further\\nbut in certain scenarios you'll see\\ncontainers padding and margin property\\nbehaving differently especially when we\\nhave a container with a text inside of\\nit\\nand maybe you can check it out over here\\nhow let's press command shift R then you\\nhave wrap with container property\\nand your you know you can just pass in a\\nchild then in the container you can\\nfirst of all set\\nthe padding property which is going to\\nbe constant Edge in such whenever you\\nhave padding or margin related stuff you\\nneed to use Edge and sets then you have\\nagencies.all 10 then you have margin of\\nagencies.all 10 again this is going to\\nbe constant and then you can set a color\\nproperty and the color is going to be\\ncolors.black okay let's save it come\\nover here\\nyou see first thing to note is the\\ncontainer takes only as much space\\nthe font requires it doesn't take the\\nentire width of the screen like the text\\nfield does\\nit only takes as much space as it\\nas its child requires\\nonly as much space as this text requires\\nif I reduce its font size to 1 it will\\ntake only this much space if I increase\\nits font size it will take as much space\\nas this text requires even column did\\nthe same thing right we have seen that\\nearlier container does the same thing\\nso basically the child is determining\\nhow much the height and width of the\\ncontainer should be unless I\\nspecifically go ahead here and type\\nheight should be 400 which should be 299\\nokay then it doesn't follow the\\nconstraints or the sizing of text it\\ntakes the entire space however I'm not\\ndoing that\\nbecause here I want to achieve a\\ndifferent purpose as you can see over\\nhere\\nthere's some sort of padding over here\\nhowever when I remove this\\nthe container is squashed even further\\nright with this padding I am determining\\nhow much spacing should be there over\\nhere\\nbut when I remove padding\\nI'm not configuring anything inside but\\nwith margin I'm configuring\\nsomething over here\\nwhen I remove margin from here you'll\\nnotice\\nthat this goes down all right let's save\\nit and you'll see the difference between\\nthis text field\\nand the text size decreased because the\\nmargin is removed when I put back margin\\nlet's put all of them in one screen so\\nthat you understand this further\\nand then when I save it\\nyou can visibly see the difference over\\nhere\\nso that's the difference between padding\\nand margin padding is related to the\\nstuff inside and margin is related to\\nthe stuff outside I hope that was clear\\nnow let's\\nmaximize our code editor and this looks\\ngood now also let's remove the color and\\nthe entire container property so I'll\\npress Ctrl shift R remove this widget so\\nI remove the entire container and its\\nproperties and we come over here this\\nlooks good now the next thing we want to\\ndo is add\\na button but I hope before going into\\nthe button you understood the difference\\nbetween padding and container padding is\\njust one widget and container is made up\\nof many many other widgets and that\\nincludes the padding widget\\nbut I always prefer using padding when\\nonly padding is required you know I get\\nto know\\nwhat exactly is happening over here if I\\nuse container I'll be curious to know\\nhey am I doing anything else in the\\ncontainer but anyways it depends on your\\npreference there is no performance\\ndifference and now the final thing of\\nour UI the button now how do we put a\\nbutton over here so in material design\\nbuttons can be classified broadly into\\ntwo categories one is the buttons which\\nare raised and other one is where the\\nbutton appears like a text all right\\nso the race button is kind of like an\\nactual button\\nthat you might see on any\\nwebsite\\nappears like a text button is something\\nthat looks like a text but is actually a\\nbutton so first let's take an example of\\nhow text button looks and then we can go\\non to the raised button\\nso to create a text button we have to\\ntype text\\nbutton how convenient\\nand now it requires two arguments which\\nis on pressed and child when I click on\\ntext button it automatically completes\\nthis for me and asks me to put the\\nrequired arguments so for onpressed we\\nrequire something known as void function\\nand that can be nullable so basically we\\nneed to pass in a function over here and\\nwe can take the advantage of anonymous\\nfunctions that allow us to create a\\nfunction over here\\nso this function does not have a name of\\nits own\\nbut\\nit is a function\\nkind of like a Lambda function in Python\\nif you've coded in it\\nthen we have a child which requires a\\nwidget now why do we require a child in\\na text button that's because there will\\nbe a button but what should the content\\ninside a button be\\nthat's what child requires so we can\\npass a text wire which says click me\\nall right now I'll just put commas so\\nthat there's nice indentation\\nnow I'll come over here\\nand you see click me is shown over here\\nand this acts like a button why because\\nwhen I long press over it\\nit gives me a splash effect that you can\\nsee in the blue color\\nthat's a button\\nnow if I click on it nothing happens\\nthat's because in this function we have\\nnot done anything so in our function\\nover here we can pass\\nlet's say a print call so we'll go ahead\\nand pass print here and says button\\nclick we already know what a print\\nfunction is right and here I'm just\\nsaying that whenever this button is\\npressed I want the print statement to be\\nprinted out in the console so I'll press\\ncommand J to open my debug console again\\nnow I'll just restart my entire app\\ncome over here click on this button\\nand you see button clicked if I click it\\nagain\\nI see two written over here that means\\nbutton was clicked again now if I again\\nclick there's three times button clicked\\nso this is what this function does\\nwhenever you click on it\\nit runs the particular function\\nand it requires a type of only function\\nyou cannot put some integer value over\\nhere or some string value over here or\\nwhatever you cannot do that because it\\nis of the type function like this and it\\nreturns a void so you don't have to\\nreturn anything from here like this you\\ncan just do this\\nor you can just leave it because that's\\nvoid now let's see why we get these two\\nerrors this error we get because\\nwe have to put a const before a text\\nthis text button does not require a\\nconstant\\nnow you might ask why why does it not\\nrequire a constant when this is has a\\nConstructor of constant that's because\\nwe have this function over here whenever\\nwe have a function to be passed in\\nlike this\\nit cannot be a constant button to prove\\nthis if I just remove on pressed you see\\nwe get\\na warning here use const with the\\nConstructor to improve the performance\\nbut then we also get an error saying the\\nnamed parameter on press is required\\nso this is the reason why we have to put\\na const for the text if const for a text\\nbutton was allowed\\nthen we wouldn't have to put a constant\\nfor this text\\nI've explained this to you before and\\nlet's go ahead put a constable now why\\nare we getting a warning over here and\\none problem I have with warnings is that\\nI have to hover over them to understand\\nwhy the warning is there in the first\\nplace\\nso\\nwhat can I do such that my warnings are\\nseen over here I don't have to hover\\nover a particular thing and see the\\nwarning so for that we have a vs code\\nextension we can go to the extensions\\ntab type your\\nerror\\nlens\\nthen we have to choose this one\\ngiven by Alexander we can install\\nand now you'll see your errors and\\nwarnings are seen in the same line\\nso this error lens makes sure that all\\nyour warnings and errors are seen in the\\nfile itself and you don't have to hover\\nover them I just prefer this way because\\nI get to know instantly what the warning\\nor error is\\nand it says don't invoke print in\\nproduction code try using a logging\\nframework and this error is there\\nbecause\\nof a certain thing known as lint which I\\ntold you I'll cover later on now if you\\nagain go to analysis option.yaml you see\\ninclude package flutter lens and that is\\ncoming from the dev dependency flutter\\nlens surveyor\\nwhat flutter lens does is encourage good\\ncoding practices you can see that in the\\ncomment over here\\nnow you can set your own coding\\npractices in the analysis option.yaml\\nfile where you have the linter for\\nexample if I an uncomment this line so\\nI'll press command slash to uncomment\\nthe line then I'll click on command s\\nwhich saves the file and come over here\\nthe warning for print is gone even if I\\nopen the debug console in problems there\\nare no problems\\nbecause\\nhere I've set a rule saying that avoid\\nprintlint should be set to false\\nif I set it to True which is by default\\nand come away I get the warning again\\nand I'm not going to meddle with the\\npreset\\nlint which\\ntells us to not use print and production\\ncode\\nand that's simply because if you print\\nstuff out you can also print\\nsome confidential information and\\nbecause of that your users might be able\\nto see it if they have rooted devices or\\nthey figure out a way to do so\\nso definitely we are not going to use\\nprint like this there are two options to\\nuse print now\\neither you can go ahead and use debug\\nprint\\nthe difference is debug print requires a\\nstring only you cannot pass anything to\\na print statement like we could in print\\nbecause it required an object\\nand we already know object is a super\\nclass of all the data types we know\\nso now we can use debug print and that\\nremoves the warning for us\\nor what you can do is\\npass an if check over here and check if\\nwe are in debug mode\\nonly then do we want to\\nprint this\\nnow what is debug mode now there are\\nthree types of mode in our applications\\ndebug release and profile\\nright now\\nwe are in the debug mode\\nbasically just testing our application\\nbuilding new features and all of that\\nrelease is how your app will look like\\nin production\\nand profile is a mixture of debug and\\nrelease and release you won't be able to\\nsee\\nmany error messages or later on we'll\\nsee that when we add some other packages\\nthey also print stuff out we won't be\\nable to see that in release mode we can\\nsee that only in debug mode now what\\nprofile does is run the app and release\\nmode\\nbut give us our nice error messages\\nwarning messages if there are any\\nand basically print is saying that hey\\nyou can only use me in debug mode so now\\nthat's why we are put debug print\\nnow we are saying that hey if we are in\\ndebug mode now how do we check if the\\napp is in debug mode or in release mode\\nto check that we have K debug mode given\\nto us by flutter\\nnow if you see this is coming from the\\npackage flutter Source Foundation\\nconstants dot dot if we press command\\nand go inside you'll see K debug mode is\\nequal to not release mode and not\\nprofile mode that means debug mode is\\nwhen\\nit's not a release mode or profile mode\\nso it's definitely a Boolean value and\\nif it's a Boolean value we can just pass\\nan if condition like this and print it\\ninside\\nnow the error is gone because we are\\nprinting in the debug mode in release\\nmode we won't be able to\\nsee the Sprint message now you might be\\nasking hey that's fine now I understand\\nthis but how do I run my app in release\\non profile modes to do that you can\\nsimply go to the terminal and run\\nflutter run dash dash release to run it\\nand release mode but release mode\\ndoesn't work on iPhone simulator\\nyou can run it on an iPhone actual\\ndevice\\nand same goes for profile mode you\\ncannot run profile mode on an iOS\\nsimulator so what I'm going to do is at\\nthe end Maybe\\nwe'll try to run it on real devices and\\nsee how it feels cool\\nso now that we are done let's get back\\nto our text button and let's improve the\\ndesign over here first of all I want\\nthis text to say\\nconvert instead of saying click me so to\\nchange that I can just change the text\\nlayer and have convert save it and when\\nI come back over here it's convert cool\\nnext thing I want to do is\\nmake sure the button background is black\\nso to do that I'll have to use one of\\nthe text buttons properties\\nnow let's take a look at the properties\\ntext button gives us\\nit gives us on pressed which is a\\nrequired argument on that we already\\nfilled that\\nthen we have\\non long press so what should happen when\\nyou long press the button what should\\nhappen when you hover over the button by\\nhovering it means when you just\\nhave your cursor on the top of this\\nbutton this is especially used in\\nweb applications because sometimes you\\nmight want to change how your\\nbutton looks or how your\\nentire UI looks when you hover over a\\nbutton then there's on Focus change\\nwhat happens when you change the focus\\nthen the style that's what we are\\ninterested in right\\neven for the text we had textile\\nproperty\\neven for\\nthe hint text or label or prefix\\neverything had its own style\\nso we can focus on style over here as\\nwell so that's what we want\\nlet's go ahead and put it over your\\nstyle which will be button style exactly\\nwhat it requires and we can create an\\nobject of the button style class like\\nthis\\nnow we have two problems here first one\\nis the child argument should be last in\\nwidget Constructor invocations that\\nbasically means that whenever you create\\na new widget child cannot be over here\\nit has to be the ending property\\nall the other properties should go above\\nchild\\nand this does not have any performance\\nimpacts but it's just readable code\\nbecause basically you're in a widget\\ntree right and if you have a text button\\nit's good to see the last thing over\\nhere\\nit's just a matter of preferences if you\\ndon't like this you can definitely go\\nahead and Analysis option.aml and make\\nsure you add a lint\\nso that you avoid this kind of warning\\nyou can do that and the next is we have\\nto use a constant before button style so\\nlet's use it all right now if we do this\\nmuch nothing really changes because we\\nhaven't provided any properties to\\nmaterial button Style\\nnow the first thing that I want to do is\\nchange the background color of the\\nbutton so let's get access to the\\nbackground color\\nand it's not simple as it looks it\\ndoesn't just ask for a color it asks for\\nmaterial State Property with a generic\\ntype of color which can be nullable and\\nmaterial State Property is also nullable\\nand that that makes sense right\\nif we remove background color it works\\nif we want to put a background color\\nthat also works so nullable makes sense\\nand then if you want to pass a color you\\ncan pass if you don't want to pass a\\ncolor you can't pass it now how do I\\nmake sure material State Property is\\nadded over here to do that let's create\\nmaterial state\\nproperty and create an instance but if I\\ndo that it gives me an error because\\nit's an abstract class\\nso we cannot use material State Property\\nhowever we have something known as\\nmaterial State Property all that we can\\nuse\\nnow if I come over here you see class\\nmaterial State Property all it requires\\nthe same generic type that our material\\nState Property requires\\nand it implements it\\nso that's why we can use it in\\nbackground color\\nnow if you hover over this it is smart\\nto identify that it requires a property\\nor the value of a color why because your\\nbackground color required material State\\nProperty color\\nand when we use material State Property\\nall it automatically\\nsaid hey use color so we have to pass in\\na color over here now what is my\\nbackground color going to be well\\ncolors.black let's try that save it come\\nover here and we have a button showing\\nup the next thing I want to do is change\\nthe text style so\\nto do that I can maybe try to change the\\ntextile property over here let's go\\nahead and try to do that we have textile\\nthen again we'll pass material State\\nProperty all then we'll pass a textile\\nsaying let's say color is colors Dot\\nwhite maybe that looks good\\nthen we'll save it\\ncome over here\\nand nothing really changes if I try to\\nrestart the app still nothing changes\\nthe reason for that is if you hover over\\nthis property it says the style for a\\nbuttons text widget descendants so we\\nare doing the correct thing\\nbecause buttons text widget descendant\\nis our text over here but the color of\\nthe text style is typically not used\\ndirectly the foreground color is used\\ninstead\\nso we need to use foreground color and\\npass that in so we can have material\\nState Property all then we'll pass\\ncolors dot White\\nlet's remove the textile property and\\nlet's see if that works\\nbecome aware and boom that works we have\\na nice button displaying here and maybe\\nyou're satisfied with this UI but I'm\\nnot\\nbecause what I want to do is increase\\nthe button's height and width and maybe\\nthe font size of this text as well\\nso let's do that first we'll focus on\\nthe sizing so to increase the sizing we\\ncan do size\\nand it doesn't really have a size\\nproperty but it does have icon size\\nfixed size maximum size minimum size and\\ntap Target size\\nicon size is the size of the icon inside\\nof the button but we are not using any\\nicons so we can ignore that then we have\\nfixed size so what will the fixed size\\nof the button be irrespective of what\\nscreen size we are on if we are on a\\nsmaller device or we are on a bigger\\ndevice the size will remain the same so\\nlet's go ahead with fixed size\\nand that requires again material State\\nProperty all\\nand then we need to pass in something\\nknown as a size\\nis size a class is size an enum what is\\nit well size is a class it already gives\\nus an auto suggestion if I tap over it\\nit gives me\\ntwo things to password width and height\\nto pass a width\\nmaybe I can say 200 that should be\\nenough and height will be 50. now if I\\nsave it come away my buttons\\nheight and width both have increased but\\nI'm not satisfied with how much the\\nwidth increased I wanted to take the\\nentire space just like the text field\\ndid\\nso maybe I can pass\\nthe width as 300.\\nthen maybe we can try 350.\\nstill not enough so we can go ahead with\\n400 and that's enough but that's not all\\nmaybe we have to do 410\\nand that's enough\\nbut what will happen if I use a smaller\\nor a bigger device\\nor if we just take a different device\\naltogether what will happen will the\\nthing be the same so let's go ahead and\\ntry it I'm just going to call my pixel 6\\nemulator you can just call it like this\\nyou know just click over here start the\\npixel 6 emulator from here you don't\\nhave to go to Android Studio to start it\\nnow\\nafter this device is selected I can\\nclick on run run without debugging or\\nyou can start debugging whatever you\\nwant\\nI'll run without debugging press command\\nJ go to the debug console\\nyou see we have a bunch of Errors over\\nhere but that's related to when\\nwe put a textile property for this\\nbutton Style\\nand then you see we have reloaded which\\nis hot reload when we save it hot\\nReloaded\\nbut anyways I don't want to focus on\\niPhone emulator now I'll just change the\\ndevice and focus from iPhone to pixel\\nand now I'll see all the\\nwarnings\\nproperties calls related to my Android\\nemulator okay and we see that it has\\nstarted if we come over here\\nthere we go we have our app right here\\nbut that's the problem when we are 400\\non a different device size it looks\\nproper but on an Android emulator it\\nlooks different and if you open web it\\nmight look different\\non a smaller device we might even get an\\nerror why\\nbecause let's say I put 450 over here\\nbecause I want to cover the entire size\\nso this is what fixed size means no\\nmatter what the device size is no matter\\nwhat the device screen is\\nthis is going to be the size and it\\nworks fine you know\\nit works well the problem here isn't\\nabout the fixed size property or any\\nproperty that we are using it's about\\nthe fixed value of the width that we\\nneed to give is there no way such that I\\ncan give maximum value to the width how\\nmuch ever it requires it can take\\nwell there is a property to do so we\\nhave double\\nyou know this double\\ndot Infinity\\nso if we click command click on double\\nwe'll go into the dot implementation of\\ndouble\\nand double is an abstract class as well\\nbut we are not instantiating the double\\nClause we are not doing double like this\\ninstead we are calling the static\\nproperty of Infinity on it and infinity\\nis one one divided by 0. so it's\\nbasically saying that take maximum\\namount of space possible and if I save\\non it right now and put commas\\ncome over here\\nwe get back our normal button\\nbecause that's the maximum amount of\\nspeeds this button is taking in fixed\\nsize property but what will happen if I\\nuse minimum size minimum sizes that that\\nyou need to take at least this much size\\non whatever device you're on and if I\\nsave it there we go on both the screens\\nour buttons are looking similar because\\nthey are taking the maximum amount of\\nspace possible\\nand what will happen if I do maximum\\nsize and save it we'll get back to our\\nnormal button\\nbecause what what it's saying is\\nthe maximum size of this button should\\nbe double dot infinity and 50. but if\\nyou can have this value you should take\\nit\\nbut in the\\nmaximum screen device this is what the\\nbutton should have\\nbut anyways we are going to go ahead\\nwith minimum size because that's what we\\nwant we want it to extend till the\\nentire end of the screen now you might\\nask hey this doesn't look good I want\\nthere to be this spacing\\nand we are going to tackle that the same\\nway we tackled our text field we are\\ngoing to wrap it with the padding widget\\nso we are going to come to the text\\nbutton press command shift r\\nthen wrap it with a padding widget and\\nhave Edge and such dot all 10.0 and\\nthere we go on both the device screens\\nwe have similar spacing perfect\\nnow you might have a question why do I\\nhave to wrap it with a padding widget\\nwhy can't I do something like double dot\\nInfinity minus let's say 40 because\\nhere from the left hand right side you\\nhave 10 10 so not 40 double dot Infinity\\nminus 20 and then save it the reason for\\nthat is double dot Infinity isn't a\\nvalue\\nthat you can\\ncount it is infinity\\nit is an infinite value and you're\\nsaying that minimum size should be this\\ndouble dot Infinity is saying that you\\ncan take as much size as possible on the\\nscreen\\nand then if you do double dot Infinity\\nminus 20\\nusing Infinity minus 20 which is still\\nInfinity\\nso it doesn't have any effect over here\\nthat's why you have to use the padding\\nalso there is no other button style\\nproperty that will help you to remove\\nspacing from here\\neither you'll have to set\\nproper constraints but that will differ\\non every screen size\\nor you'll have to\\nmake a way like using a padding widget\\nusing double dot infinity and all of\\nthat stuff\\nso let's put a padding 10 again\\nand this looks good on all the screen\\nsizes perfect\\nnow this is what text looks like\\nwhat will elevated look like then so\\nthis is what the text button looks like\\nwhat will the raised button appear like\\nso to configure that we can just go\\nahead and\\ninstead of text button have\\nsomething known as elevated button and\\nyou see we don't get any errors because\\nit requires the exact same things on\\npressed as a required property child is\\na required property and the same style\\nis required all the properties are same\\non pressed on long press on Hover but\\nwhat changes is the design year\\nyou might say hey there's no difference\\nI cannot see anything but there it is\\nthis button right here is raised a\\nlittle bit what I'm going to do is put\\nthis in a side by side view so that you\\nunderstand this better\\nlet's come over here\\nlet's get back to text button save it\\nand you'll see some sort of elevation is\\ngone\\nif I save it again\\nsome kind of elevation is there\\nelevation is added by putting some sort\\nof background behind it there's some\\nkind of Shadow to it\\nto show this elevation I'm just going to\\ngo ahead and Pass elevation 15\\nand elevation doesn't require double it\\nrequires material State Property double\\nso let's go ahead and pass material\\nState Property all\\n15 like this save it and you see there's\\nmore Shadow behind so it appears more\\nelevated it gives a more you can say 3D\\nview it's not exactly 3D but it gives a\\nmore\\n3D kind of effect\\nthat's what elevated button does and by\\ndefault it has its own elevation Setter\\nbut text button does not have any\\nelevation set\\nso it's kind of like a simple flat\\nbutton and the fun fact is\\nelevated button was previously called as\\nraised button and text button was known\\nas flat button\\nbecause elevated button was erased and\\nflat and text button was flat\\nbut then they decided to change it in\\nlater versions of flutter so I hope you\\nunderstood the difference between these\\ntwo type of buttons now you can\\nobviously go ahead and configure more in\\nthese buttons for example you can set\\nthe shape let's go ahead and set one so\\nwe have shape and that also requires\\nmaterial State Property all\\nand then requires outlined border so\\nlet's go ahead and pass outlined border\\nbut there's nothing like\\noutlined border like this because it is\\nan abstract class so again we need to\\nfind something that extends outline\\nborder so for this we have multiple\\ntypes\\nlet's go ahead with the one I know oval\\nborder you see\\nas the name suggests it will be able to\\ncreate an oval border also if you press\\ncommand and go into the source code it\\nover border extends Circle border which\\nis another border you can also use\\nCircle Border in your code if you just\\ngo here and use Circle border that will\\nbe fine\\nbut at the end of the day Circle border\\nalso extends outlined border so oval\\nborder extends outline border all right\\nnow if I save it come over here this is\\na button\\nlooks kind of weird then we also have\\nthe circle border you can try that\\nthen\\nthis kind of Border will look better on\\na button that requires an icon in our\\ncase we don't require an icon we just\\nrequire a text\\nbut what I'm seeing is this might look\\nsomething like this you can have an icon\\nover here which will be icons dot let's\\nsay convert that's nothing like that so\\nmaybe\\nicons Dot money just to demonstrate you\\nsee this looks good enough and when you\\nadd elevated button on top of it this\\nwill look much better\\nall right so this is what Circle border\\ncan be used with oval border might be\\nthere to create some\\ndifferent UI style I don't know why\\nanyone would use oval border to be\\nhonest in a production ready app that\\nneeds serious\\nattention all right\\nthen the other border that we have is\\nrectangle border\\nso we have\\nthree types of rectangle border beveled\\nrectangle border rounded rectangle\\nborder and contain as rectangle border\\nlet's go ahead with the rounded\\nrectangular border save it come over\\nhere and we have a button looking the\\nway we wanted it to now we can make some\\nadvancements here because it requires\\nBorder Side border radius everything\\nthat we've seen before you can configure\\nover here\\nand all of that is named arguments\\nfor example you can just go ahead and\\nmention border radius then you have\\nborder radius Dot\\ncircular\\n10 also remove constant here because as\\nwe know border radius dot circular isn't\\na constant put constant for everything\\nso let's go ahead and put it\\nsave it come over here and you see this\\nkind of design and this actually looks\\ngood I'm happy with this\\nthen we also have beveled rectangle\\nborder it also has a border radius\\nproperty but we are just going to skip\\nthat save it\\nthe difference here is this is pointy\\ninstead of having\\narcs\\nin the edges over here\\nand the last one is continuous rectangle\\nborder let's save it if you want you can\\njust go ahead using beveld rectangle\\nboard not be weld sorry rounded\\nrectangle border and it will give you a\\ngood enough design\\nnow if you want to reduce the\\nborder radius you can do that also let's\\nput some formatting in place\\nby putting some commas and this looks\\ngood I'm satisfied so yeah this works\\nwell also I'm just going to keep the\\ntext button I'm not going to use\\nelevated button now let's remove all the\\ncomments and yeah this looks good\\nnow you might see that they're spacing\\nhere between this button and this text\\nfield already that's there because of\\nthe padding property added here here we\\nhave added a padding property saying\\nEdge and such dot all 10. so from all\\nthe sides there is a padding of 10 from\\nthe top from left from right and from\\nthe bottom\\nthat's why they're spacing over here\\nso we are done with the UI but still you\\nmight be not convinced by what the style\\nrequires right because every single time\\nwe have to pass in material State\\nProperty all then mention the color or\\nmaterial state property or then mention\\nthe size material State Property all\\nthen mention the shape or the Border\\nnow that is a lot of tasks to do so\\ninstead of doing that we have an\\nalternative what we can do is\\nis do text button Dot and we have an\\noption of text button dot style from\\nby using text button dot style from we\\ndon't have to mention material State\\nProperty all for everything you directly\\nget options to color shape\\nminimum size fixed size maximum size all\\nof those things so you can just go ahead\\nand use text button.style from but since\\nI'm lazy to type it all again I'm going\\nto undo everything I did\\ncopy this line right here press command\\nshift Z to redo everything so that I\\ncome back to text button dot style from\\nand I'll just paste everything back\\nnow I can remove all the material State\\nProperty alls from here\\nand just put the required\\ncolors and sizes all right\\nso that will work as well\\nbut make sure you do it nicely otherwise\\nyou might get confused with the brackets\\nand will\\nmiss one of the brackets\\nalso put a const here because size\\nrequires that\\nand text button dot style from doesn't\\ngive us constant thing because it is a\\nfunction functions cannot be constant\\nright\\nnow if we save it like this\\ncome over here\\nwe have a text button showing as it is\\nas it was before no changes but instead\\nof having\\nmaterial State Property all for\\neverything we have our simple colors and\\nsizes passed cool so I hope you're\\nconvinced by this also if you have\\nelevated button you can go ahead and use\\nelevated button dot style from and it\\nwon't stop you you'll be able to do all\\nthe stuff great so we have a functioning\\nUI now this is all that was required for\\nour simple currency converter app\\ncongratulations on being done with the\\nuser interface we have learned quite a\\nlot even if you think it's a small\\noutput\\nso you can leave the user interface at\\nthis this looks decent enough\\nbut if you want to add something there's\\none element you can add which is an app\\nbar an app bar is the header thing that\\nwe see right at the top you can add that\\nso let's go to our scaffold\\nit is not included in body right because\\nit's a header why will header stuff be\\nincluded inside of a body\\nheader is included inside of a scaffold\\nthere is an app bar so you can go ahead\\nand pass an ABBA an app bar requires\\nsomething known as a preferred size\\nwidget but yeah you can go ahead and\\nPass App barrier why because app bar\\nextends\\nor implements a preferred sized widget\\nand preferred size widget implements a\\nwidget all right and if you see\\npreferred size widget\\nis an abstract class which just has one\\ngetter inside of this\\nget preferred size\\nand app bar implements that\\nsave it and you see our entire user\\ninterface is looking quite different\\nthat's because by default the app bar\\nhas a color of blue\\nand that is something related to theming\\nwhich we'll get to when we build our\\nsecond application\\nbut as of now we don't want this to be\\nblue or anything we just want it to take\\nthe same color as this background color\\nso to do that we can change the\\nbackground color and set it equal to\\ncolors.blue gray exactly what the\\nscaffolds background color is\\nbut still we have this sort of elevation\\nhere so we can remove this elevation by\\nsetting the elevation property of the\\napp bar to zero and once we do that the\\napp bar is gone now you'll ask hey\\nwhat's the purpose of adding an ABBA if\\nyou just wanted to erase it the reason\\nfor that is at the top I just want to\\nmention\\ncurrency converter\\nso an app bar requires some sort of\\ntitle and here we have a title it\\nrequires some sort of text right title\\nis a perfect choice for it\\nso we'll pass\\ntitle here and it the title requires a\\nwidget so you can just pass in a text\\nwidget and say\\ncurrency\\nconverter also put a constable here save\\nit come back and we have currency\\nconverter display\\nthis is our app bar title in Android it\\nshows up on the left hand side in iOS it\\nis right in the center\\nso you can use either of them if you\\nstrictly want to Center the title you\\ncan go ahead and set the property of\\nCenter title to true and if you do that\\nit is centered in both the places and if\\nyou set to false it will be aligned in\\nthe left hand side for both of these\\ndevices also if you want to change the\\ncolor of this textile you can change it\\nby passing in a style textile what we\\nhave already seen before color colors\\ndot black all right now if we come we\\nhave currency converter displaying like\\nthis but I don't like how it looks with\\nthe style so I'm just going to keep it\\nlike this good\\nAbba also has multiple other options\\nlike if you want to increase the size\\nyou can add a bottom preferred size\\nwidget so that can be an app bar again\\nand you'll be able to have two app bars\\nthen we have actions which requires a\\nlist of widget now what is actions\\nactions is\\na bunch of\\nbuttons or a bunch of widgets that you\\ncan show in the right hand side corner\\nover here\\nso we can have actions like this and\\nlet's say you want to display a text\\nhere saying hello\\nsave it and you can show hello there now\\nthis actions usually contains icons and\\nstuff so that you know if you want to\\nexit the app or do anything else you can\\nuse that using actions actions is not\\nused for displaying text\\nnow if you take an example of WhatsApp\\nWhatsApp has a\\nbunch of\\nactions so it has the video calling icon\\nthe phone\\ncall icon and the more options I can all\\nof those are\\nactions then we also have leading this\\nis also particularly icon or if you want\\nto display an image but it's generally\\nnot for text\\nwhat leading does is shows some widget\\nover here and it only requires one\\nwidget actions can have a list of\\nwidgets just like a column but\\nthey are displayed in a horizontal\\nManner and leading only requires one\\nwidget\\nnow we'll get to all these properties\\nlater on when we build our shopping app\\nbut for now we don't need to get into it\\nand I'm also satisfied with the currency\\nconverter app that we have till now now\\nlet's figure out how can I make sure my\\napp functions right so when I've\\nmentioned the USD let's say 1.0 to 8\\nand click on convert I want to convert\\nto INR now how can I do that\\nthis sounds very easy all we need to do\\nis first step is create a variable\\nthat stores the converted\\ncurrency value\\nso right now we have the zero the\\ninitial value of the variable is going\\nto be 0 then whenever we pass something\\nlike 1.08 to it click on convert we'll\\nmultiply 1.08 to the standard exchange\\nrate that we have let's say 81 because\\none USD is 81 so we'll multiply 1.08\\nwith 81 and whatever answer we'll get\\nwe'll store in that variable\\nso we the second step is just going to\\nbe to create a function that multiplies\\nthe value given by\\nthe text field\\nwith 81 or whatever exchange rate you\\nhave maybe you're not converting from\\nUSD to INR you're converting to some\\nother value you can use that value not\\n81.\\nthen the third step is\\nto store the value\\nin the variable that we created\\nright so we created a function that\\nmultiplies the value with 81 then we are\\njust touring the value in this variable\\nthat we created and then\\nwe only have to display that variable\\nsounds easy doesn't it\\nso let's try to do this in our stateless\\nwidget so let's go ahead and do our\\nfirst step create a variable that stores\\nthe converted currency value and also\\nwhat I'm going to do is copy all of this\\nand paste it outside of the class that\\nwe have I'm not going to keep it inside\\nbecause it just obstructs my view and\\nwill make it difficult for me\\nnow what I'm going to do is go ahead and\\ncreate a variable inside of this class\\nso I can just go ahead and create a\\nvariable and result is equal to 0.\\nbut then we get an error saying this\\nclass or a class that this class\\ninherits from is marked as immutable why\\nbecause we are extending a stateless\\nwidget right and I told you in the\\nbeginning of the\\nflutter section that the stateless\\nwidget\\nis immutable\\nany Fields inside of it cannot change\\nand here we are allowing it to change\\nbecause it is not a constant or it is\\nnot a final if we put Final End Result\\nover here the error will get resolved\\nbut if we just put end result that means\\nthis value can be reassigned this is a\\nmutable variable and it cannot be\\npresent inside a stateless widget\\nso what can we do if we put final we\\nwon't be able to change the value so it\\ndoesn't make sense to make it final\\nhowever what we can do is put it inside\\nof the build function right if we put it\\nand result is equal to 0\\nit will work fine because this is a\\nfunction and function you can change the\\nvalue but inside a class a global\\nvariable you cannot change\\nthe value if it's immutable so end\\nresult is equal to 0 is fine in this\\nfunction\\nnow what I want to do is\\ntake this value\\nfrom the text field\\nand multiply it by 81 whenever the user\\nclicks on convert\\nnow how do I get the value from the text\\nfield\\nif I come over here does text field have\\nany of the properties not really if you\\nuse on submitted which is one of the\\nfunctions text field provides\\nyou'll see we get a value\\nand if we try to print the value\\nI'm just printing it not debug printing\\nit because I'm going to remove this line\\nand open the debug console\\ncome over here and let's say I type 1.2\\nconvert\\nbutton click comes\\non submitted is not triggered at all\\nbecause on submitted is triggered when\\nwe click on return button from our\\nkeyboard once I click on enter from the\\nkeyboard we get 1.2 so this on submitted\\ngets triggered when the text field is\\nsubmitted and that's not the layout of\\nour app\\nif the user clicks on return that's fine\\nor even then we can do something but\\nwhen the user clicks on convert which is\\nanother button that we've given them\\nthen also it needs to get triggered\\nso we cannot use the on submitted\\nproperty\\nthen what can we use such that whatever\\nvalue is present inside the text field\\ncan come to this elevated button\\nmeaning we want to get a value\\nprovided by the text field or the user\\ninput which is given to the text field\\nthat is available throughout our entire\\nclass because if elevated button can\\naccess it any widget can access it right\\nso for that again we might have to\\ncreate something in the build function\\nor you can do that in the stateless\\nwidget itself\\nwhat we need to create is\\na text editing controller so we'll go\\nahead and have text editing controller\\nand you're just going to name it text\\nediting controller which is equal to\\ntext editing controller\\nnow again we get the same errors that we\\ndid before but this time there's going\\nto be a change we are going to call this\\nfinal text editing controller but as\\nsoon as you put final aware you see\\nwe still have an error can't define the\\ncons Constructor because the field text\\nediting Constructor is initialized with\\nthe non-constant value\\nwe get this error because text editing\\ncontroller if we click and go to the\\nsource code\\nis not a constant Constructor\\nso we'll have to remove constant from\\nhere\\nthat means we'll have to remove constant\\nfrom the material app and as I've told\\nyou multiple times before it will not\\nhelp in boosting the performance of our\\napp and I tell you why when we get into\\nanother type of widget\\nin a few minutes\\nso again in this text editing controller\\nneeds to be shifted at the top we can\\nput the constant back\\nand the constant is here as well great\\nnow why is this text editing controller\\nconstant because text editing\\ncontroller's value is not going to be\\nchanged\\nwe just have to take this value\\nand paste it inside of our text editing\\ntext field you see we have a controller\\nproperty we can pass it over there so we\\npass that\\ntext editing controller paste it and\\nthere we go\\nnow through this text editing controller\\nwill have access to\\nall the user inputs so if we come over\\nhere in elevated button let's remove all\\nof this and we'll print text editing\\ncontroller if we just print that we'll\\nget something like instance of text\\nediting controller because text editing\\ncontroller is a class right however\\nlet's try this\\nI'm also going to go ahead and restart\\nthe app\\nI'll enter the amount so let's say 1.5\\nconvert\\nand we get text editing controller and\\nyeah we are able to see all of the\\nproperties inside of it\\nso we have text editing value with the\\ntext\\nand the text is 1.5 which is correct\\nthen the selection is there then text\\nAffinity is there\\ncomposing is there and all of that stuff\\nwhat we care about is text\\nso we are just going to access that so\\nwe are going to have text rating\\ncontroller Dot and we see we have text\\nwe can use that\\nso this will give us the text that we\\nrequire now we'll come here again\\npress 1.7 convert\\nCtrl J and we have 1.7 so it correctly\\ngives us the right\\nanswer in the elevated button that's\\ngood now what I want to do is print\\ntext editingcontroller Dot text into\\n81 let's say that's the current exchange\\nrate from USD to INR\\nit's a rough value obviously but let's\\ngo ahead with this let's restart our app\\ncome over here we are going to type 2.5\\nconvert\\nand here we see 2.5 to 0.52.52\\nso this is not what we want why is that\\nthe case this is the case because text\\nediting controller.txt gives us a string\\nand we have already seen in the dot\\ncourse that\\nstring into an integer will multiply\\nthe string that many times so we have\\n2.5 2.5 2.5 written out 81 times it's\\nnot actually multiplying but it's just\\nconcatenating adding the strings\\ntogether\\nso what we need to do is convert this\\ninteger\\nor convert the string into an integer\\nand then multiply it with 81. so we can\\nhave end dot parse and actually\\nwe cannot have just in dot pass why\\nbecause n dot parse guarantees us that\\nwe'll get only an integer but what if a\\ndouble is mentioned over here like 2.5\\nso we'll have to make this double dot\\npass\\nand then wrap our text\\neditingcontroller.txt like this\\nso what double dot pass does is convert\\nthe string into a double and integer dot\\nparse converts the string into an\\ninteger okay\\nso let's try to do this press command J\\ncome back over here let's type in 2.5\\nagain click on convert and we have 202.5\\nwhich is correct 81 into 2.5 is 202.5\\nperfect\\nso that means you are getting a value\\nnow we just need to store this value\\ninside of our result variable so let's\\nget rid of them\\nwe are just going to go ahead and type\\nresult is equal to\\ndouble dot pass\\ntext editingcontroller Dot text\\ninto\\n81 but now if you see this we get an\\nerror why because\\na value of type double cannot be\\nassigned to a variable\\nthe variable of type integer\\nand that's because the result is an\\ninteger and this is converted to a\\ndouble and double into an integer will\\ngive you a double\\nso you'll go ahead and change result to\\na double correct\\nsave it come over here and\\nwe have successfully changed the result\\nnow if we see this we should be seeing\\n2.5 convert and this text isn't changing\\nwhy\\nand we are no longer getting the print\\nstatement we are not getting the print\\nstatement because we have removed the\\nprint statement from on pressed but we\\nshould be seeing the change in text\\nright not exactly because in text if we\\ngo we still have a hard coded 0\\nmentioned over here\\nhard-coded 0 is not what we want we want\\nresult to be mentioned over here so we\\ncan go ahead and pass result\\nand now we get an error saying argument\\ntype double cannot be assigned to\\nparameter type string because text\\nrequires a string and result is a double\\nso what you can do is\\nresult Dot tostring and that will\\nconvert text to\\na string right\\nso to summarize to convert from into\\nstring\\nyou have to do\\nthe integer value\\ndot to string anything you want to\\nconvert to a string you just call the\\ntostring method on it because that's\\npresent on almost every object\\nand if you want to\\nconvert from string to int or double you\\ndo string value\\nand wrap it with n dot parse or double\\ndot pass all right\\nlet's see with this but you're still\\ngetting an error arguments of a constant\\ncreation must be constant Expressions\\nthe reason for that is this result\\nvariable is changing right\\nthis is a mutable variable it's\\nimmutable aware and it's mutable because\\nof that\\nso it's saying that hey result is\\nmutable so this text cannot be a\\nconstant\\ncan it\\nso we'll have to remove this constant\\nwe'll have to put constant textile\\nsave it\\nand\\nwe still have a warning over here you\\ncan see it over here so let's go at the\\ntop and see we have this warning which\\nsays unused import\\nbasically saying that this line you have\\nimported but it\\nisn't in use in your code\\nso we can just remove this save it let's\\nrestart the entire app and Hope\\nthat this works so we'll go ahead first\\nof all we can see the change 0.0 because\\nthis is a result double value double to\\na string will give you a string like 0.0\\nthen we'll enter the amount in USD let's\\nsay 4.5\\nconvert\\nand nothing changes inside over here why\\nif we press command J\\nthere's no error as well it should be\\nchanging right\\nnot exactly because right now what\\nyou've done is created a result variable\\nyou've\\nchanged the result variable over here\\nbut you've not\\ntold this function to rebuild so the\\nresult value has its own new\\nvalue all right there's no disagreeing\\nwith that the result has a new value\\nbut this function is not rebuilt again\\nif this function is not rebuilt again\\nwe don't see the changes over here\\njust think about it we have a result\\nvariable at the top then you change the\\nvalue so the value has changed now what\\nthat's the end of the function that's\\nthe end of everything now what should\\nthe function do\\nexactly the function has nothing left to\\ndo\\nand it doesn't automatically see the new\\nvalue compare the new value and display\\nit\\nso we need to make sure that we call\\nthis build function again so how do we\\ncall this do we go ahead and call build\\nlike this\\nand hope that works so let's go ahead\\nand try it so we are going to have\\nplease enter the amount in USD we are\\ngoing to have 2.5 click on convert and\\nstill nothing changes it's just not\\ncalling the build function again let's\\ngo ahead and try it so in our build\\nfunction what I'm going to do is print\\nrebuild all right so right at the top of\\nthis function whenever this function\\ngets called we're going to go ahead and\\ncall the rebuild function\\nso that will let us know if this\\nfunction is being rebuilt so at first\\nthis function is getting rebuilt right\\nbecause as soon as we extend the\\nstateless Widget the build function is\\nthe first thing that is called\\nwhen you instantiate this now the first\\nthing the Constructor gets called First\\nand after that the build function is\\ncalled\\nand the build function is called\\nautomatically that's why we get the\\nrebuilt first\\nbut then when I put the value let's say\\n2.5 click on convert the rebuild is now\\n2 that means this is getting rebuilt so\\nwhy are we not seeing the output we are\\nnot able to see the output because\\nthis function runs again and as a result\\ndouble result is equal to 0 so it gets\\nre-initialized to zero the text editing\\ncontroller is now remade and everything\\nelse is also rebuilt so the entire thing\\nis rebuilt as a result\\nthe result is still zero we are not able\\nto see the changes\\nso what should we do to\\nget rid of this error maybe try creating\\na global variable try creating it\\noutside of this class so I'll just have\\ndouble result is equal to 0 like this\\nand maybe that works so let's restart\\nthe app and have 2.5 click on convert\\nand we are still not able to see the\\nanswer\\npress command J there's no error\\nthere's still two rebuilds\\nso this doesn't work\\nso let's get back to normal and\\njust don't ever try to create Global\\nvariables unless it's really required\\nbecause Global variables are bad\\nI've already mentioned why in the dot\\nsection\\nits value can be changed from any class\\nany function and if you have like 20 for\\na small\\napplication 20 classes you will be able\\nto change results from everywhere and\\nthat's not a good thing because you\\nmight get confused at some point and\\nchange the value\\nanyways now what should we do to resolve\\nthis\\nwell the main reason for all of this is\\nstateless Widget the build function is\\nnot meant for any initializations like\\nthese\\nit's all fault of the stateless widget\\nand it's not exactly a forward of\\nstateless widget as well it's a fault of\\nus because we know stateless widgets\\nshould not have any state and we are\\nstill having states of air I did so much\\nso that I could explain you why\\nthe stateless widget is immutable\\nand why you cannot change any of the\\noutput on the screen\\nin a stateless widget so what is the\\nthing we should do to resolve this well\\nextend it to a stateful widget as simple\\nas that so I'm just going to create a\\nnew class so that we see the difference\\nbetween a stateless and a stateful\\nwidget so we have a class currency\\nconverter material\\npage and I'm going to call this page G\\nall right now we have the error in\\nmain.dot file but we don't care about it\\nas of now\\nI've just renamed this class to PG\\nso that I can create a stateful widget\\nwith the name currency converter\\nmaterial page now I'm just going to go\\nahead and extend a stateful widget\\nnow as soon as I do this I again get\\nerrors because it requires methods what\\nis the method is it the build function\\nno it just requires one thing stateful\\nwidget dot create state\\nso we need to implement\\na create State function\\nif we go in stateful widget\\nand scroll down we have state create\\nstate that is what we want to do so we\\nare going to have state create State and\\nthen we want to return a state now what\\nis the state can we just return a state\\nlike this no because state is an\\nabstract class and in this abstract\\nclass we have the widget property we\\nhave our build context we have\\nsomething known as mounted but if we\\nscroll way down you will also see\\na very familiar thing here\\nand that is the build function\\nso that means we have to go ahead and\\ncreate our own class that will extend\\nthe state class\\nbecause then we'll have a format that is\\nsimilar to this thing right over here\\nbecause we'll have access to build\\nfunction\\nso now we are going to go ahead and\\ncreate a class and I'm going to call\\nthis currency\\nconverter\\nmaterial page State and that is going to\\nextend state\\nand see here how what I have done I've\\nmarked this as private class why because\\nI don't want this class to be accessible\\noutside of this file\\nonly this class should be accessible\\noutside this class should not be and now\\nI can copy this paste it inside and our\\nerrors go away because I'm returning a\\nstraight right if we extend State class\\nand return this currency converter\\nmaterial state\\nwe are returning a state I hope that\\nmakes sense we still have warnings but\\nwe'll resolve them later on\\nnow what it requires is a concrete\\nimplementation of state DOT bill and\\nit's the exact same thing as this thing\\nso you can have\\neither it override widget dot build and\\nthen we can return let's say a constant\\nscaffold\\nso we have basically two classes over\\nhere\\nfirst one is currency converter material\\npage that extends a stateful widget\\nand as a result we have to create the\\ncreate State method and here it requires\\na state but we cannot create an instance\\nof the state class because\\nit is an abstract loss\\nand the abstract class is basically\\nsaying that hey\\njust extend this get the build function\\nand then write your entire apps code\\nover here\\nnow you might ask what is the purpose of\\nthese two separate classes\\nthe reason for that is here we create a\\nstate and what state does is very\\ninteresting the state will allow us to\\ncreate our variables will allow us to\\ncreate our functions and also\\neverything inside of this class can be\\nIM can be mutable so I can go ahead and\\ntype double result is equal to 0 and\\nthat doesn't give me a warning or an\\nerror\\nit's all good inside of this\\nbut here if I try to go ahead and create\\ndouble result is equal to zero we have\\nan error this class is marked as\\nimmutable\\nbecause stateful widget\\nhas a constant Constructor but state\\ndoesn't have that it's an abstract class\\nthat allows\\nso we just need to extend State and that\\ndoes a work\\nnow we have understood the structure of\\na stateless widget and I hope you are\\nunderstanding what I'm doing\\nagain if you want a brief and you have\\nsome questions let's go along the code\\nwe have a class that extends a stateful\\nwidget then we have create State\\nfunction that creates the state\\nbut then\\nwe cannot\\ninstantiate State class aware so what we\\nneed to do is create our own state that\\nextends the state class and as a result\\nwe can put that over here inheritance\\nconcept\\nthen we need to override the build\\nfunction and here it's the exact same\\nthing as this thing you can create your\\nown stuff\\nthe reason there are two different\\nclasses is because you cannot create\\nmutable variables inside of this class\\nso that you know we still have a\\nConstructor that is constant but you can\\ngo ahead and create your own mutable\\nvariables here because this does not\\nhave a constant Constructor\\nand this is a private thing because it\\nshould be accessible only for this\\nclass so that we could create a state it\\nshould not be accessible outside of this\\nfile\\nleave outside of this file it should not\\nbe accessible outside of this class also\\nbut\\nthat's how private variables work in dot\\nwe've talked about this in the dot\\ncourse\\nso we'll have to live with this\\nnow let's resolve the warnings the first\\nwarning that we have is Constructors for\\npublic widgets should have a key\\nparameter so just like this we have to\\ncreate\\na constant Constructor so we have\\ncurrency converter material page super\\ndot key inside of a named argument save\\nit then we have creates date and it says\\nthe member create States override an\\ninherited member but isn't annotated\\nwith override so basically since this is\\nthere because of stateful widget we have\\nto put add the rate override\\njust like we did with the build function\\nright and there we go we have created it\\nnow there are still some things you can\\ndo if you want to improve for example\\nState takes a generic type of a t that\\nextends stateful widget so you can have\\na generic type over here and it should\\nbe a stateful widget so you can go ahead\\nand pass currency converter material\\npage\\nbut then we get an error over here\\nsaying the currency converter material\\npage\\ncan't be returned from the method create\\nState because it has a return type of\\nState currency converter material page\\nbut you'll say hey that's the same thing\\nhappening over here right not really\\nbecause here extend State we also have\\nto put the generic type again which is\\ncurrency converter material page as soon\\nas we do that we get the errors resolved\\nbasically since you have not typed\\nanything over here in the T\\nit wasn't able to identify that these\\ntwo things are of the same\\nclass and their stateful widget is the\\nsame currency converter material page\\nbut it's still an improvement and if you\\ndon't put it it's fine\\nand if you put it it's better\\nawesome\\nso now what I'm going to do is show you\\nthe difference between the stateless and\\nthe stateful widget in stateless widget\\nwe just add a Constructor and then we\\nadd the override here we have a\\nConstructor we have create state that\\ncreates our class over here\\nthen we have our override build function\\nand then a scaffold\\nnow the state\\njust doesn't do this it gives us access\\nto multiple more methods if you press\\ncommand and go inside of it we get\\naccess to a getter called widget we also\\nhave access to build context\\nso yeah you can use context over here\\nit's accessible\\nhere the build context was accessible\\nonly inside the build function but their\\ncontext is accessible even inside of\\nthis state\\nthen we have access to mounted which we\\nlook at in a while\\nNH state\\nthis is one important method that we'll\\ngo into take a look at later on then we\\nhave did update widget another important\\nthing reassemble\\nthen set State a very very important\\nthing that we are going to take a look\\nat in this\\napp itself then\\nwe have deactivate and we have activate\\nand then we have dispose another very\\nimportant thing\\nso it has access to methods like this\\nwhich will give us more capabilities\\ninside of our stateful widget with\\nstateful Widget with stateless widget\\nsorry you don't have access to any of\\nthose things\\nokay anyways\\nnow what I want to show you is\\nwhat all things get called over here so\\nI'm just going to remove this\\nwe have our currency converter material\\npage only or actually press command Z\\nlet's copy the entire build function so\\nthat we don't have to rewrite all the\\ndesign that we created let's put it over\\nhere\\nlet's get rid of the class now okay so\\nbuild function has this thing we don't\\nhave to type it again\\nnow we have rebuilt over here\\nokay inside of the build function I'm\\njust going to call this build function\\nthen I'm going to call\\ncreate state I'm going to convert this\\nto a block this is not an arrow function\\nanymore it's a block and we are going to\\nreturn\\ncurrency converter material page State\\nfrom here but I'm also going to print\\ncreate state\\nthen we are going to have our\\nConstructor and I'm going to have\\nprint\\nConstructor\\nand then it says constant Constructors\\ncannot have a body so let's remove\\nconstant for now only for now we'll put\\nit back but I just want to show what all\\nthings get called okay\\nnow we'll press command J we'll restart\\nour entire app then we have Constructor\\nthe first thing that gets called is this\\nthing then create state which is this\\nthing and then we have build function\\nbut what if you have certain tasks that\\nneed to be done before the build\\nfunction but are accessible only inside\\nof this class\\nI mean let's say you've created a\\nvariable double result\\nbut you're not getting the value over\\nhere it's a late value maybe you call an\\nasynchronous function and\\nyou're getting the value after let's say\\ntwo seconds\\nhow do you make sure that you get it\\nbefore the build function is called\\nbecause you need to display it right you\\nneed to display it over here so for that\\nreason we have a method given by our\\nstate class which is init state\\nall right\\nso as soon as we type in it it\\nautocompletes it for us but if you want\\nto know the syntax it's just at the rate\\noverride because it's coming from the\\nstate that we are extending then we\\navoid init state\\na function\\nthen we can remove two to implement in\\nits state\\nthen we call super.net state which calls\\nthe init state of the parent class and\\nwe've already seen this this thing is\\nour state class all right let's go at\\nthe top to see\\nthis thing right here this is the state\\nclass\\nso it calls the energy State of the\\nState class and does whatever it needs\\nto do for example the state life cycle\\ncreated\\nnow what is the state life cycle what\\nI'm showing you right now is widget\\nState life cycle of a stateful widget\\nthat means what all stuff gets called\\nwhat all stuff\\nexecutes when\\nso when does\\nin its state get executed\\nwe'll just put print rebuilt over here\\nsave it\\nand come over here let's restart the app\\nand we have Constructor create State\\nrebuilt\\nbuild function\\nso Constructor is called create state\\nbut now instead of build function we\\nhave the rebuilt being called init state\\nso NH state is what gets executed\\nright before the build function\\nso if you want to assign any values that\\nare coming from let's say some futures\\nor streams you can do it in any state\\nbut for simple initializations like ours\\ndouble result is equal to zero\\nyou can put it over here like this\\nso let's get rid of them\\nand let's convert everything back to\\nnormal\\nso let's have something like this done\\nwe have an arrow function\\nwe have a Constructor and this is a\\nconstant even in the main function then\\nor a main file we have to put const\\nthree\\nso we have got double result over here\\nlet's remove that save it restart come\\nover here\\nand let's put text editing controller\\noutside of this build function why\\nbecause build function should always be\\nas less expensive as it can be why\\nshould the build function be\\nless expensive because build function\\ncan potentially be called in every frame\\nbecause of a function that we call all\\nright\\nthere's a function that will trigger the\\nrebuild of this build function so this\\nfunction can potentially be called in\\nevery frames so if you have a phone that\\nhas a refresh rate of 120 hertz\\nyour build function can be called 120\\ntimes in one second\\nand if it is called that many times\\nthat means your build function needs to\\nbe less expensive it cannot have any\\nasynchronous tasks first of all\\nof that needs to be done in the currency\\nconverter material page state\\nnot in the build function because\\nasynchronous task can take like one two\\nseconds and in one second you have to\\ncall 120 times if it is done\\nso if it is called 120 times per second\\nyou have like 8 milliseconds to run all\\nof the build functions or or the stuff\\ninside of this build\\nfunction because one second is thousand\\nmillisecond and it can be called 120\\ntimes so 1000 divided by 120 which is 8\\nmilliseconds\\nso it's always good to keep this method\\nas efficient as possible so you don't\\nhave to put any asynchronous tasks\\nyou don't have to do\\nanything that will be expensive this\\nthing over here is not expensive you're\\njust assigning a variable which does\\nhardly anything\\nyou can also push this right at the top\\nbut since it is UI related I like to\\nkeep it inside of the build function\\nonly\\nand if you don't\\nreturn a result in the given time frame\\nit can result in frame drops so it can\\ncause UI stuttering and will cause lags\\nin your UI which is not a good thing\\nfor the user experience so always keep\\nthis build function as simple as\\npossible and here it's quite simple\\nanyways we have our result now and we\\nhave changed the value but still\\nlet's remove build context from here the\\nthing is the same\\nwe have our variable created here\\nthen we have\\nresult is equal to double dot parse into\\n81\\nand we are not triggering the build\\nfunction rebuild\\nso what should we do then\\nwell we can go ahead and call the build\\nfunction like we did and let's see what\\nit does let's restart Also let's print\\nrebuilt aware that looks kind of\\ninteresting\\ncome over here and we have 2.5 convert\\nnothing happens\\nbecause in the build function you don't\\nhave to call\\nre uh build function again\\nright this is not the good way of doing\\nit\\nwhat you can do instead is call a\\nfunction that is provided by state and\\nwe've looked at it before in the state\\nclass as source code which was such\\nState I told you that this is a very\\nimportant function right so what you\\nneed to do is search date and it\\nrequires you to put in a function void\\nfunction function so you have this\\nAnonymous function here and then you can\\npass this thing right yeah\\nnow if you restart\\nand I don't know why but I removed\\nrebuilt print statement so let's put\\nrebuild again\\npress command J restart the app and now\\nif I put 2.5 click on convert yes we see\\nthe output 202.5\\nand it was rebuilt\\nwhy that's what such does\\nwhat set state does is set the state if\\nyou dive into the source code you won't\\nbe able to understand anything but here\\nat the end there's one thing element dot\\nmarks need Mark needs build\\nbasically saying that it's telling\\nthe widget tree not widget tree\\nsomething known as Elementary but we'll\\nget to it after the second app\\nbut it's just telling that hey this\\nwidget needs a rebuild but that doesn't\\nmean it will start rebuilding this\\nentire class again no\\nit will only build this build function\\nonly this function gets called again and\\nnecessary widgets are rebuilt\\nnow\\nthe set States function doesn't do\\nanything okay if you want you can just\\nput it here like this and it will work\\nthe same way all right so if you have\\n2.5 it will still work the same way this\\nfunction is given to you so that it is a\\nconvenience for you to put everything\\nthat needs a rebuild inside of here\\nhowever what set state does is just tell\\nthe widget tree or the elementary will\\nget to it\\nthat this particular thing needs a\\nrebuild so build the build function\\nagain and only build the necessary\\nwidgets you see it notifies the\\nframework that the internal state of\\nthis object has changed the internal\\nstate of our object is the result\\nvariable that we created\\nand whenever you change the internal\\nstate of a state object\\nwe did change the internal State of the\\nState object via our state and this was\\nour object we change the value so we\\ncall such state\\nalso this function that we have cannot\\nreturn a future it cannot be\\nasynchronous\\nand then you can read all of this thing\\nif you want to and gain extra knowledge\\nbut as of now what's important is that\\nthis calls build function only that's\\nwhat it does triggers a rebuild\\nusing the build function\\nperfect so we've converted our currency\\nfrom USD to INR\\nnow if I change it to 80 and restart my\\nentire app let's say I put 2.5 this\\ngives me 200 great if I put 2 click on\\nconvert 160 if I put 150 convert I get\\n12 000.\\nand if you want to do something extra\\nwhat you can do is put INR over here but\\nwe have to encapsulate everything in a\\nstring\\nso we'll just have dollar result\\ndot two string\\nbut I've already mentioned it to you if\\nyou have result.2 string inside of\\nstring interpolation we can skip\\nresult.2 string and we can just have INR\\ndollar result\\nand now we have INR 12000 if you want to\\nput a Rupee symbol or your currency that\\nyou've converted you can put that\\nso that marks the end of our currency\\nconverter material app\\nnow let's take a look at what Cupertino\\napp looks like I hope you are familiar\\nwith all the code that we have written\\ntill now we have gone through a lot\\nwe've gone through stateless widget\\nstateful widget the state set State NH\\nState we are going to dive into sets in\\nits state and all of that set state is\\nalmost required everywhere\\nso we'll keep using that and we'll keep\\nbrushing our concept I hope you also\\nunderstood the purpose of text editing\\ncontroller text editing controller gives\\nus access to text in the entire widget\\nwherever we want\\nand last thing that I'd like to mention\\nis the on press function over here\\nsince this is a function that requires a\\ntype of void function like this you can\\ngo ahead and create\\na function over here so let's copy it\\nand have void convert\\nand paste this over here also remove the\\nbrackets this thing right here convert\\nnow you can go down\\nand pass it to on pressed so you can\\neither do it this way convert like this\\nor\\nyou can just pass convert like this\\ndon't call it like this you have to call\\nit like this why because convert has a\\nfunction type of void function just like\\nthis requires so it's a tear off\\nfunction\\nsince both of them match in what they\\nrequire void function and this is also\\nthe same thing\\nyou can just pass it like this however\\nwhen you call it this\\nit means you're calling the function and\\nyou don't have to call the function in\\non press because when you call it you\\nreturn a type of void\\nand void cannot be assigned to on\\npressed\\nso that's why you just have to put\\nconvert over here and that will work as\\nwell such state is accessible throughout\\nour currency converter material page\\nState and widgets are always immutable\\nthe state makes this class mutable so\\nthere is no performance\\nimpact on our widget\\nthis is still a constant but this isn't\\nso we have mutable stuff over here and\\nthat is why we have two classes many\\npeople don't understand this but I hope\\nyou've understood this also let's remove\\ncolor from here and we have our app\\nready so we have a currency converter\\nmaterial page ready there's still a lot\\nof stuff you can do there is a lot of\\nedge cases that you can handle for\\nexample\\na UI change\\njust take a look at this you have a\\npadding over here which has agencies.all\\n10 then you have a padding over here\\nwhich has agencies.all 10 so what you\\ncan do instead is just wrap this entire\\ncolumn with a padding widget instead of\\nwrapping all of the widgets separately\\nin a padding widget\\nso what you can do is\\nselect this copy press Ctrl shift\\nr\\nto open the refactoring option remove\\nthis Widget the same goes over here Ctrl\\nshift R remove the switcher then you can\\nwrap the entire column\\nby doing comma Ctrl shift R wrapping it\\nwith\\na padding widget and pasting our\\nagencies.all 10 over here\\nand once we do that\\nwe have spacing left from here but all\\nthe spacing beneath it is gone so we\\nneed to add that\\nso do you mean I have to put text field\\nagain in a padding widget no then what\\nis the sense of making padding widget\\nover here no what you can do is use a\\ncontainer right by container you can\\nmention a height let's say you want to\\nleave a height of 10. then the same\\nthing you can save it and you have your\\nheight left out\\nbut here's the problem this container\\ndoesn't have a constant\\nConstructor\\nand as a result\\nwhen I have to rebuild this container\\nwill also get rebuilt unnecessarily\\nthat's what constant does\\nwhenever your function is going to get\\nrebuilt your widgets will also get\\nrebuilt what constant sees it\\nis this doesn't need a rebuild because\\nthis is a constant if you have a\\nconstant it will not read need a rebuild\\nbut container doesn't have that\\nand it will be unnecessarily rebuilt\\nbecause\\nwe just have to leave a space we just\\nneed to leave a height why can't it be a\\nconstant then that's why we have access\\nto constant sized box size box helps us\\nleave a space you know container is a\\nall-in-one widget it will help you to\\nadd height width padding margin color\\nbut what size work does is just help you\\nleave width height\\nand it has a constant Constructor so\\ninstead of using container everywhere\\nyou can use a size box it doesn't have\\nany difference in the UI but it does\\nhave a difference in performance now\\nit's a very very small impact\\nbut it still has an impact\\nso let's try to make our apps as\\nefficient as possible so with this we\\ndon't have to wrap any other widgets\\nthat we'll add inside of the widget tree\\nwith a padding widget all of them will\\nhave their automatic padding and now\\neven text has a padding\\nso if it exceeds this length it still\\nhas a padding so that's great and one\\nlast Edge case that I can see is if I\\nput 2.52 click on convert I have this\\nbut if I put multiple digits we have our\\nINR extending till below I don't want\\nthat maximum I want is let's say\\none or two digit I don't want it this\\nprecise so what I can do is\\nwrap this and have dot two string and\\nyou have multiple methods for it two\\nstring two string as exponential two\\nstring as fixed and two string as\\nprecision\\nI'll use two string as precision and\\npass 2 over here\\nand when I do that I get INR 2.0 e plus\\n2. now this is not in the format I want\\nif you use calculator you know what this\\nis talking about if you haven't don't\\ncare about it I don't want it like this\\nwhat I want is to string as fixed Maybe\\nthen we can add 2 over here and we have\\nINR 201.77\\nso it only gives me a maximum of two\\ndigits and if you want you can give\\nthree widget and it will work fine then\\nrestart and you add INR 0.0.00\\nnow if you want to avoid this whenever\\nyou have 0 you don't want it to extend\\ntill 3 does it\\nafter the decimal place what you can do\\nis\\nadd a ternary operator over here inside\\nof this\\nstring interpolation itself what you can\\ndo is if result\\nis not equal to zero so if result is not\\nequal to 0 then we want this thing right\\nsince our result was not 0 I wanted\\n204.480 but since my result is not 0\\nanymore\\nI'll want\\nresult dot 2 string\\nas exponential\\nzero\\nso I don't want there to be any\\nexponents now if I restart\\nI get e again but that's not I want\\nsorry I want to string as fixed\\nand then we can save it we come over\\nhere we get inr0 but if I put 2.566 like\\nthis I get three digits maximum so we\\nhave handled the edge case over you are\\nusing the ternary operator now you know\\nhow everything is coming back to its\\nplaces we learned everything separately\\nin the dart course and now everything is\\ncoming together you can't use an if\\ncondition over here\\nbecause you know it doesn't make sense\\nhow can you use it inside of a string\\ninterpolation\\nso you can go ahead and use\\nternary operator\\ngreat so this is our app for the\\nmaterial page I'm going to get done with\\nthis now now what we are going to do is\\ngo ahead in the lip folder and create\\ncurrency converter Cupertino\\npage dot dot now you're going to have a\\nCupertino design so let's go ahead and\\ndesign it so the first thing to do here\\nis to import material.dot right not\\nreally because when we import\\nmaterial.dot we get all the widgets\\nrelated to material design\\nlike this elevated button but we don't\\nwant that so I'm going to go ahead and\\nimport\\ncupertino.dot which is similar to what\\nwe saw earlier\\nall right\\nnow cupertino. will give us only the\\nthings that\\nare following Cupertino design now we\\nhave to go ahead and create our state\\nfull widget now do I have to type the\\nentire stateful widget here that can be\\ncumbersome right\\njust writing all of these classes\\nI made you type earlier so that you\\nunderstood what was happening here but\\nnow that we have understood it we can\\ntype here SPF L and you see we have\\nsomething known as a code snippet\\nwhen we click on this we get all the\\nboilerplate code required to create a\\nstateful widget\\nthis is provided by the flutter and Dot\\nvs code extension that we added so now\\nwe have access to the currency\\nso now we have access to the state full\\nwidget snippet we also have access to\\nstateless widget snippet I'll show you\\nafter we type the name of this class now\\nI don't want my class name to be my\\nwidget right so it already highlights\\neverything for me and all I have to do\\nis type the name so we have currency\\nI made a typo we can type currency\\nconverter Cupertino page all right and\\nit changes it everywhere there is so\\nwherever it's necessary it will change\\nit now I can save it and there we go now\\nit is returning a please holder for us\\nwe don't want that what we want is\\nall the things that are returned over\\nhere and then we can go ahead and change\\nwhatever is not required so let's go\\nahead copy this\\nreturn the build function because at the\\nend of the day we need to have the same\\nkind of layout\\nbut now we have many errors we'll solve\\nthem but before that let's go ahead and\\ncopy the logic as well all the text\\nediting controller result and all of\\nthat\\nnow we can come over here save it and\\nthere we go the errors reduce but in no\\nway are they lesser why because we have\\nintroduced cupertino.dot and outline\\ninput border scaffold ABBA all of them\\nfollow the material design\\nyou see stuff like Center padding column\\ntext are not affected by Cupertino or\\nmaterial design they are present in both\\nof them Cupertino and material because\\nthe\\ntypography is not decided by the text\\nitself it is decided by what we are\\nreturning away a material app or\\nCupertino app\\nand then we have column which is a\\nlayout thing padding which is basically\\njust leaving space so it doesn't have to\\nfollow material or Cupertino design\\nguidelines and Center is again\\na design guideline\\nand Center is again\\na layout widget\\nso now we have to go ahead and change\\neverything\\nfirst of all I'm going to go to the\\nmain.dot file I'm going to create a\\nstateless widget here so to create a\\nstateless widget you can type St L and\\nthen you have a snippet for stateless\\nwidget as well\\nyou click on this and then it creates\\nall the boilerplate code for a stateless\\nwidget now you can just type my\\nCupertino app\\nokay then you are going to return this\\nexact thing but instead of material app\\nyou're going to have Cupertino app\\nand this also accepts a home argument\\nthough these two things are different\\nkubatino app doesn't have the same theme\\nthat it requires it requires Cupertino\\ntheme data and this requires\\njust a theme data\\nokay so there are differences but\\nanyways now let's take this\\nput it over here we all have my\\nCupertino App instead of my app so it\\nwill run this class not this class\\nso this class is basically never\\nexecuted\\nnow we can save this\\nalso we can have currency converter\\nCupertino page instead of currency\\nconverter material page otherwise it\\nmight give you some weird output\\nnow let's come back over here now we are\\nreturning a scaffold scaffold is\\napparently a part of material or not so\\nwhat we need to do here is return\\nCupertino scaffold\\nscaffold\\nallows you to create\\na an app bar at the top so we definitely\\nwant Cupertino page scaffold\\nthen it has multiple things it doesn't\\nhave the Abba property or the body\\nproperty let's see what it requires it\\nwants a child property so our child is\\ngoing to be this thing which is nice\\nand then we have navigation bar so we\\ncan return a navigation barrier\\nand in navigation bar it requires\\nobstructing preferred size widget it\\ndoesn't require preferred size widget\\nanymore which is what app bar is\\nand also app bar is from material.dot so\\nmaybe we can go ahead and type Cupertino\\nAbba and maybe we get something but no\\nbut if we type Cupertino\\nnavigation bar\\nwe get that and Cupertino navigation bar\\nis exactly what we can pass over here\\nnow gopertino navigation bar is the same\\nthing as app bar at the top\\nso we don't need to worry about it\\nthen it has a bunch of properties what\\nwe require is a title and if we come\\nover here\\nwe see a widget which is middle and as\\nyou already know in iOS Style\\nthe title is always always Center if it\\nis already centered\\nit makes more sense to name it middle so\\nwhat do you want in the middle\\nso we can have middle over here sweet\\nand if you see there's no thing as\\nelevation over here because Cupertino\\nwidgets don't really have any elevations\\nor depth to them\\nso we can remove this\\nnow to resolve the colors error if we\\npress command full stop to get a list of\\nfixes we can apply to a project we see\\nimport Library package flutter\\nmaterial.dot because\\nmaterial.dot also includes the colors\\nyour app is going to have\\nso we cannot use the colors class but we\\ncan go ahead and use Cupertino colors\\nand it gives me a bunch of colors now\\nI'm going to go ahead and have Cupertino\\ncolors Dot\\nblue then we have two type of colors\\nsystem blue or Active blue\\nI don't want any of those maybe Gray\\nlet's go ahead with system gate grade 3\\nthen we can save this much then we can\\nagain copy this and the exact same thing\\nlet's hope we like the version that it\\nspits out\\nAlso let's put a const over here because\\nCupertino colors\\nare constant all right\\nwhy because if we come over here it is\\nabstract final class right\\nso let's exit this\\nnow let's scroll down we have text field\\nso instead of text field here what we\\nrequire is Cupertino\\ntext field there we go\\nas easy as it gets\\nwhatever is there in material.just put\\nCupertino before it and it will become a\\nCupertino widget\\nit has the same property of controller\\nbut color again we'll have to put\\nCupertino colors dot black so that's\\nfine\\nI'll copy this line again and paste it\\nover here\\nbut here the decoration requires box\\ndecoration\\nand box decoration is\\nnot related to input declaration so we\\nhave to get rid of input decoration and\\njust pass in box decoration over here\\nnow let's design everything that we have\\nthe first thing we need to mention is\\nthe border so let's go ahead and pass in\\na border now the Border it requires is\\nbox border so maybe we can type in box\\nborder but that isn't allowed\\nhowever if we just type border dot all\\nit allows us to pass it in so we can\\njust have border.all\\nthen we need to mention the color of our\\nborder and the color of our border is\\nthe default one so we're just going to\\nleave it at that then we also have to\\nmention the Border radius the Border\\nradius is 5 so let's go ahead with that\\nlet's take the default one then we have\\nborder radius\\nand the Border radius is going to be\\nborder radius dot circular five that's\\ngood\\nnow we can try to mention the color as\\nwell\\nso the color of the text field we want\\nis\\ncolors.white so we can go ahead and pass\\nCupertino colors dot y I guess that will\\nwork right\\nand that's all that we require so maybe\\nwe can just get rid of all of this\\nwe still need to mention hint text so\\nlet's copy it and then get rid of this\\nand see the decoration doesn't give us\\nproperties to change the hint text\\nhowever Cupertino text field does give\\nthose properties and there we have it\\nplaceholder we also have the prefix\\nwidget and it doesn't have all of those\\nprefix stuff\\nlike prefix icon prefix prefix style it\\njust has prefix which requires a widget\\nthat is cool\\nso if we go ahead and type hint over\\nhere there's no hint related stuff\\nbut\\nif we type placeholder and then type\\nplease enter the amount in USD that\\nshould work\\nand then finally we need a prefix widget\\nwhich is I can ikins dot monitor not I\\ncan we cannot use icon why where are the\\nicons\\nis also coming from material.dot we\\ncannot use that\\nso we can go ahead and type something\\nlike Cupertino icons and there we have\\nit so we can pass in Cupertino icons Dot\\nmoney\\nand it does have money dollar sign\\nexactly what I need\\nand put a const over here perfect\\nso this looks good now the final thing\\nthat I need to work on is button\\nelevated button is also coming from\\nMaterial design now you might have\\nnoticed that everything that was UI\\nrelated changed from material to\\nCupertino dot dot\\nand all the layout widgets like column\\npadding Center and text because that\\ndepends on cupertino.settings or\\nCupertino app settings\\nthat's fine\\nso let's go ahead and instead of\\nelevated button we are going to use\\nCupertino button as simple as it gets\\nthen Cupertino button requires a child\\nwhich we have already passed then it\\nrequires a color\\nso what is the color you want so the\\ncolor I want is\\nblack so we are going to have Cupertino\\ncolors dot black\\nthen I want something sizing related so\\nwe have minimum size\\nmaybe we can look into that so we have\\nminimum size and that is a double\\nthe default is K minimum interaction\\nDimension Cupertino let's go over that\\nwhenever you have\\nsomething like K it is meant to be a\\nconstant\\nthat's flutter's way of saying that hey\\nthis is a constant now we can dive into\\nthis and we have 44 showing here and\\nthen it has design guidelines about it\\nso I'm not going to meddle with it I'm\\njust going to keep it as it is and see\\nwhat the output is if I want to change\\nit I can go ahead and change it right\\nand then maybe I can remove all of this\\nthe only thing that's left is to make\\nsure the color is white and\\nthe shape is rounded rectangle border\\nwith a border radius of 5. so let's get\\nrid of it\\nand almost all our errors are done let's\\nalso remove this because border is not\\nbeing used in text field anymore\\nso let's get rid of this save it\\nrestart our entire app Ctrl J\\nor command J no problem we come away and\\nour entire apps design is now changed\\nthis is how it looks in Cupertino design\\nand I'm quite satisfied with how the\\nbutton is looking over here so I'm not\\ngoing to meddle with the size however\\nyou can go ahead and change it also if I\\npass 200 click on convert it's still\\nworking if I press 12 it's still working\\ngreat\\nso this is how the app looks in\\nCupertino design this is how the app is\\ngoing to look like in material design\\nyou can design for yourself which one\\nyou want I like this one better because\\nit gave me more customizability\\nand I just like the design and feel of\\nit\\nI don't like how the text Fields look in\\nCupertino design the main difference is\\nthat material design follows a more\\nDynamic and Visually Rich approach it\\nuses Shadows depth effects bold colors\\nand it often incorporates elements that\\nmimic Real World objects and materials\\nthat's why material design\\nnow Cupertino design has a more\\nminimalistic and flat aesthetic and\\nfocuses on Simplicity subtle gradients\\nand\\nalthough I do like minimalistic design\\nCupertino design is just not my taste\\nso from now\\non I'm going to go ahead and\\ndesign only material designed\\napplications if you want you got a taste\\nof how Cupertino Works basically any\\nwidget you have\\njust put a Cupertino before it and\\nyou'll get a widget similar to that and\\nif you don't you always have Google\\nwhere you can ask your question\\nabout the equivalent of\\nlet's say a particular widget in\\nmaterial design\\nin Cupertino design okay\\nso we are done there's one last thing\\nthat I want to mention and that this\\ngoes for both of these\\nclasses currency converter material page\\nand currency converter Cupertino page\\nand that's the use of text editing\\ncontroller whenever you\\nany form of controllers later on we'll\\nsee that there are a bunch of\\ncontrollers\\nlike there's animation controller or\\npage controller draw controller scroll\\ncontroller stream controller which we've\\nalready seen\\nall of those need to be canceled or\\ndisposed of\\nso that they don't have any data leaks\\nor memory leaks in your application\\nso for that reason\\nthe state also gives us a nice property\\nor a nice function which is the dispose\\nfunction\\nin dispose function\\nit is usually recommended to put\\nsuper.dispose at the last and in its\\nstate you might remember that super.net\\nstate should be the first thing and\\nafter that you will have rest of the\\nother things because then you want to\\ncall the parent class and initialize\\neverything but in this pose you just\\nremoving certain objects from your\\nwidget tree\\nand this dispose is called whenever your\\nwidget is no longer existing maybe you\\nmove from one page to another by\\nreplacing the current page this is when\\nthe dispose\\nfunction will get called so in that case\\nyou don't want to instantly delete or\\ndispose of whatever is present in the\\nstate class first you want to dispose of\\nyour own\\nclasses\\nyour own controllers and streams or\\nFutures whatever you want to dispose\\nand then you'll call Super dot dispose\\nto dispose of everything that's present\\nin the\\nState class all right so here what I'm\\ngoing to do is pass in my text editing\\ncontroller and call dispose method on it\\nso this will dispose of the text editing\\ncontroller it will\\nbasically discard the entire text\\nediting controller and say that hey this\\nobject is basically not existing anymore\\nand that avoids memory leaks all right\\nso you can consider dispose to be\\nkind of like the exact opposite of NH\\nstate in its state gets called\\nbefore the build function before\\nanything builds and this pose gets\\ncalled right after the entire widget\\nis going to get discarded\\ncool so let's get rid of this and now we\\nare done with our entire\\ncurrency converter app congratulations\\non building your first ever flutter app\\nwhich is working quite well\\nto understand about widget life cycle we\\nmust first know what widgets are and\\nwhat a life cycle is everything in\\nflutter is a widget so before knowing\\nabout lifecycle we must first know what\\nthe widgets are and if you are seeing\\nthis video there's a great possibility\\nthat you have already created widgets in\\nyour app to Define it in the least words\\npossible widget can be considered as\\nevery class you make and can call in the\\nbuild function without any errors and if\\nyou don't know what build function is it\\nis a function that is used to render\\nsomething on the screen every flutter\\napp is a combination of two type of\\nwidgets stateless widgets and stateful\\nwidgets stateless widgets are those type\\nof widgets where the state once created\\ncannot be changed that is it can run\\nonly once which is when the app is\\nloaded this also means that this type of\\nwidget cannot be redone after any user\\ninteractions\\nthis is an example of stateless widget a\\nstateful widgets on the other hand are\\nwidgets where the state can be changed\\nand we can make this build function over\\nhere run multiple times with different\\nwidgets to render or different string in\\na text any value can be changed now\\nlet's understand the life cycle of these\\nwidgets so we are back to our stateless\\nwidget and as you can see that the my\\nstateless widget which is a class name\\nof a stateless widget has overridden the\\nbuild function here which can written\\nreturn only one widget at the end which\\nhere we are returning a scaffold so\\nwhenever my stateless widget is\\ninstantiated it will call the build\\nfunction and draw that one widget on the\\nscreen\\nso if we have to understand it in a\\nchart flowchart format\\nfirst we call the Constructor\\nand then after which the build function\\nwill get executed pretty simple right\\nnow what about State full widgets we\\nhave a Constructor here\\nafter which the build function will be\\ncalled right no you see in this code\\ndemo my stateful widget is a stateful\\nwidget and we have a build function here\\nbut before that you can see create State\\nover here\\nas the name suggests this creates the\\nstate of our app it also returns an\\ninstance of the associated state\\nnow that we have access to the state in\\nour app flutter provides us with some\\nmethods to use as and when we want first\\nis in its state and this is how you can\\ncreate in its state function\\nwhat is in its state right in its state\\nis the method which runs once after the\\nConstructor of our app and created state\\nis called\\nsince it basically runs in the very\\nbeginning of the app we can initialize\\ndata and properties with some value we\\ncan also subscribe to streams and make\\nconnections with sockets let me show you\\na demo suppose I have a variable of data\\ntype end and I'll call it ABC and I have\\nto instantiate it with a value I can\\njust do it like this\\nor I can just\\nmark this as late\\ngo over here and put ABC equal to 10.\\nnow I'll go in the text and over here\\nI'm going to return abc.2 string since\\ntext accepts a string format\\nand I'm not going to return it as a\\nconstant because the value can change\\nnow if I go over here and let me return\\nmy state full widget over here you can\\nsee that we are getting 10 as our\\noutputted value and that is exactly what\\nwe wanted\\nnow I'll also take a moment to explain\\nthe General Internal working of NH state\\nif we scroll up and we see that our\\nclass inherits from state which is an\\nabstract class\\nas you can see over here we also have\\noverride over here which means we are\\ntelling flutter that we are putting in\\nits state over here and it isn't a\\nmistake we are deliberately trying to\\nadd our own energy State function and\\nnot use the image State function present\\nin the state abstract class super over\\nhere creates a reference to the parent\\nobject in state class\\nand then calls the NH State function\\nthere as well now where should I place\\nthe code I want to execute in the NH\\nState function right over here on the\\ntop or over or below it well flutter\\ndocumentation says that the code should\\nbe placed after calling super in its\\nstate\\nexactly like I've done for the variable\\nABC\\nbut after further inspection in the\\nstate class I'll go to the NF State\\nfunction in the state class over here\\nI found out that the initi state\\nfunction basically does nothing that\\naffects our app so I don't think it\\nmatters\\nwherever we place the code this same\\ninternal working is followed in every\\nfunction that we're going to have a look\\nat uh in the following tutorial the\\nsecond function that we have over here\\nis did change dependencies this method\\nis called immediately after energy State\\nmethod moreover this budget will be\\ncalled again after the piece of the data\\nthe widget depends on is updated this\\nfunction is used very rarely as a build\\nmethod is called after this next we have\\na function called did update widget this\\nfunction runs whenever the widget\\nattached to the state is replaced by\\nanother's widget here you can see that\\nwe are also getting our old widget which\\nis replaced and if you want to get the\\ndata of the new widget\\nyou can just do print and use the widget\\nthat we always have\\nthis function is used rarely as well\\nlast method we have to discuss is\\ndispose\\nthis function is used to remove all the\\nconnections our app has this is a very\\nimportant function most of the people\\nforget to use and I admit even I have\\nforgotten many a times dispose is a\\nplace where we can subscribe from all\\nthe connections or listeners thus it\\nhelps us in removing some things from\\nthe app's memory and prevents our app\\nfrom memory leaks let me prove what I'm\\nsaying with the help of the code now\\nI'll write print everywhere in our app\\nand all the functions that we have\\nI'll write here from init state\\nI'm just going to copy this print\\ncommand and paste it in all our\\nfunctions\\nfrom disperse\\nfrom did update\\nsorry from dead update widget\\nfrom\\ndid change\\ndependencies\\nand even over here in the create state\\nI'm just going to replace this Arrow\\nfunction\\nI'm just going to copy this I'm going to\\nreturn this we have the my stateful\\nwidget state\\nand over here I'm going to print\\nfrom create state\\nover here as well I'm going to replace\\nI'm going to print\\nand we are going to type from\\nConstructor\\nright\\nnow we can just ignore the warnings the\\nwarnings that we have\\nI'll refresh our app\\nand let me just remove the int ABC parts\\nfrom here as well and I'm going to\\nintroduce a part of the code uh where we\\ncan see something interesting happening\\nnot just a piece of text that's showing\\nup\\nI'm going to replace this\\nwith this cool now let me run my app and\\nnow you can see that if we click over\\nhere we get a model bottom sheet with\\nwhich three uh with three options\\nand if we go over here in our debug\\nconsole let me just\\ntake this up you can see that we first\\ngo to the uh we print from Constructor\\nwhich is from your which proves that uh\\nthe Constructor is uh run first\\nafter that create state is run as I said\\nbefore then the init State function is\\nrun\\nand then did change dependencies as run\\ndid update widget and dispose do not run\\nbecause we have not uh you know updated\\nany widget we have not replaced our\\ncurrent widget with any other widget\\nalso uh dispose is run after we need to\\nclear off something suppose I have my\\nsocket over here\\nand I have initialized it I haven't uh\\ndownloaded any sockets package yet but\\nI'm just showing it for the sake uh for\\nshowing it that we can use dispose on\\nsockets and if we call dispose over here\\nit will not give us any error at all\\nand it will uh be a good thing for our\\napps memory and we should always\\nunsubscribe from all the listeners that\\nwe have so that it doesn't keep on going\\nand cause harm in our applications right\\nnow if you prefer seeing this uh\\nstateful widget in a flowchart format\\nlike we did for stateless widget here\\nyou have it\\nso our state is first created then the\\niniti state function is run then our\\nbuild function is executed\\nthen uh it checks if did update config\\nor set state in our app is called yeah\\nyou might be familiar with stat State\\nthat's why I have not included this in\\nmy tutorial right now\\nso basically if you don't know what set\\nstate is set State uh will help you to\\nrerun your build function again\\nso you can rerun this whole entire uh\\nfunction after calling such state so if\\nyou want to update any value and show it\\nuh to the user on the screen you can\\njust use such State then uh if any of\\nthese is called then it will again go\\nback and call our build function as we\\ncan see in the flowchart over here\\nthen we have our dispose function over\\nhere and after that our app is cleared\\noff now the second app that we are going\\nto build is a weather app where things\\nare going to get a little bit more\\ncomplicated but not very complicated so\\nlet's dive into it and first of all\\nlet's just see a demo of what we are\\ngoing to build so this is the weather\\napp we want to build\\nat first we have the app bar or the\\nheader kind of thing then we have the\\ntemperature showing up in Mumbai you can\\ninsert any place you want in degree\\nFahrenheit it also tells you what type\\nof weather it is like if it's raining\\nsunny and it shows the appropriate\\nsymbol for it then we get the weather\\nforecast since the time right now is 8\\n40 AM it shows me the weather forecast\\nfrom 9 am to 9 PM with 3r interval then\\nwe have additional information about\\nhumidity when speed and pressure the\\ngood thing about all of this is\\nthis is not hard-coded like we did in\\nthe currency converter app it is taking\\nactual data from the web and displaying\\nit over here so the actual weather in\\nMumbai right now is 300.67 degree\\nFahrenheit also I have the refresh\\nbutton here in case I want to rerun\\neverything and you see as soon as I\\npress refresh I get a loading indicator\\nand it pulls the actual data from the\\nweb so for this purpose we are using an\\nAPI here and we learn how to do this in\\nflutter so let's go ahead and create a\\nweather app so the first step is going\\nto be to create a flutter project for it\\nso go ahead create your own flutter\\nproject I'll CD to desktop which means\\nchange the directory to desktop and\\nafter that I'll run the flutter create\\ncommand for weather app all right\\nafter that I can change the directory to\\nthe weather app and as soon as I type\\nweather and press tab it will auto\\ncomplete it for me\\nand we'll type weather app for me\\nafter this I want to open it in vs code\\nI can either go ahead and open Visual\\nStudio code like this and you know\\nclose the current folder I'm in and just\\ndrag this app right over here or what\\nyou can do is type in code which will\\nopen up vs code for you now if it\\ndoesn't open up what you need to do is\\npress command shift p and vs code\\nthen pass\\ncode like this and you'll see this\\ncommand shell command install code\\ncommand and path once you click over\\nhere\\nyou'll be able to use code like this and\\nopen Visual Studio code from the\\nterminal itself\\nCode full stop basically means that open\\nvs code for the current folder if we\\nwere back in the desktop we would have\\nto do code dot slash weather app all\\nright and it will open up my weather app\\nin vs code gray now let's open it up\\nback\\nlet's start running our app to see if\\neverything is all right here\\nand then we'll also migrate to the lib\\nfolder in main.dot because I want to\\nmake sure you understand the default\\ncode for the counter app that's written\\nnow that you know the very basics of\\nflutter\\nso at the top we have the run app and we\\nhave my app it also extends the\\nstateless widget where we have material\\napp title this title basically tells you\\nthe thing that shows up here in Android\\ndevices for iOS it just\\ntakes the thing that is mentioned in\\ninfo dot P list now what is info.plist\\nwell if you press command p and type\\ninfo dot P list you'll see iOS slash\\nRunner all right this is present in the\\niOS folder where they have defined the\\nname for our app which is the weather\\napp\\nso it takes the name from here if you\\nwant to change the name of the iOS you\\nknow this name here\\nyou'll have to change it in iOS slash\\nRunner slash info dot P list\\nand for Android you can change it from\\nhere awesome so our app is also running\\nnow we have our theme here and it takes\\na theme data then passes in a color\\nscreen and passes in a seed color based\\non which we have our entire design ready\\nthen it also has use material 3 set to\\ntrue now there's\\nmaterial 2 and material 3 which are\\nbasically versions of material design\\nmaterial 3 came out recently and flutter\\nhas the option to use material 3 design\\nso this is how the app looks in material\\n3 design and if I just remove it save it\\nthis is how it looks in material too so\\nthat is the difference between material\\n3 and material 2. definitely I like\\nmaterial 3 better but you can look for\\nyourself\\nand this is what team does when you\\ndefine a theme over here it sets up the\\noverall coloring scheme and let's say\\ntypography all of that stuff for the\\nentire app if you want to go ahead and\\nchange a one particular screen you can\\ndo that but what theme does is set set\\nup for the entire app because that's\\nwhat material app is right\\nthen we have home where we pass in my\\nhome page and in my home page we extend\\na stateful widget we have a title\\nwhich we are taking from The Constructor\\nwhich is flutter demo home page and it's\\nshowing up in app bar so if we scroll\\ndown we have Abba\\nwhere we have title text widget.title\\nbut an interesting thing over here is\\nbackground color\\nwhat it does is theme dot off context to\\ngo to the theme then use the color\\nscheme dot inverse primary so it's\\nbasically going to this theme widget\\nright over here\\nthen it's saying give me color schemes\\ninverse\\nprimary property which is defined in the\\ncolor scheme if you scroll down you'll\\nsee inverse primary now if you set\\ninverse primary color over here let's go\\nahead and try it inverse primary colors\\ndot blue save it come over here you see\\nthe I bar is now blue in color because\\nwe are accessing color scheme dot\\ninverse primary when we don't specify\\nanything and just specify the seed color\\nit takes a light purple kind of shade\\nbut when we specify the inverse primary\\ncolor it takes a different color\\nand this is what theme is all about you\\nset it somewhere like let's say you set\\nthe theme over here and then The\\nDescendant widgets can use it or the\\nchild widgets can use it\\nthen we have Body Center column and Main\\naccess alignment Dot Center because of\\nwhich these two things are showing up in\\nthe center you can see a constant text\\nand a counter text\\nand that is why we have a stateful\\nwidget here\\nalso we have something known as a\\nfloating action button which shows the\\nbutton over here\\nnow if you wanted a normal button over\\nhere you could use elevated or flat\\nbutton or text button\\nbut since you want to use a button over\\nhere it's better to use Floating Action\\nbutton which is provided as a property\\non scaffold\\nand then you can Define The Floating\\nAction button\\nwidget and then obviously just go ahead\\nand look out for yourself like whatever\\nnamed properties are there everything is\\nwritten pure English for you to\\nunderstand\\nwe also have the tooltip property which\\nis basically like if you long press\\nyou'll see this thing right here\\nincrement text that is wall tool tip is\\nthen you have the icon as the child\\nbecause of which we have this plus\\nbutton\\nand then we have on pressed increment\\ncount and increment counter we are just\\ndoing such state\\nand in there we are changing the value\\nof underscore counter\\nso that's our counter app now we're just\\ngoing to go ahead and remove everything\\nbecause we want to build our own weather\\napp\\nand now let's start from scratch I hope\\nyou understood everything in the counter\\napp because you've learned so much about\\nstateless stateful set State everything\\nnow let's go ahead and create a class\\nI'm not deleting the main function\\nwe'll have a class called my app\\nor you can call it weather app whatever\\nyou want to call it this this today\\nshould extend stateless widget\\nand instead of doing all of this we can\\njust do stateless widget like this\\nand call Maya cool now you're having a\\nplaceholder here because of which we\\nhave this lines over here placeholder is\\nbasically telling that hey you want\\nsomething to be put up over here so I'll\\njust put it up for you\\nlike this so it indicates that you want\\nto put some kind of widget here\\nand this should take this much space\\nthis much height you see we have\\nfallback width and fallback height\\nstroke width and all of that stuff but\\ninstead of returning a placeholder we\\nwant to return a material app\\nand in material app we first want to set\\nthe home which is\\nlet's say constant where the screen and\\nthat's something I want to create\\nso let's minimize the iOS folder go to\\nthe left folder create one more file and\\nlet's call this weather underscore\\nscreen dot Rod remember the name in\\nconvention here\\nthen we are going to import material dot\\nso let's go ahead and import material\\ndot dot\\nthen we will go into create\\na state less widget let's say because I\\ndon't know if I need to put a state or\\nnot so for now let's put a stateless\\nwidget here then we'll save it I'll take\\nthis weather screen put it here\\nthen press command full stop so that I\\nget a list of quick fixes where I can\\nimport my weather screen package all\\nright\\nthen another thing that I want to do is\\nafter I save it you see this debug\\nBanner is showing this tells that our\\napp is in debug board but for now I just\\nwant to remove it completely so what I\\ncan do is debug show check mode manner\\nset it to false with this property set\\nto false\\nthe debug\\nBanner over here is removed\\nand the last thing that I want to set\\nover here is the theme so right now my\\ntheme is going to be light mode\\nso if I just return let's say a scaffold\\nhere you'll understand what I'm talking\\nabout\\nit's light mode right I want to change\\nit to dark mode so I can just do it in\\ntheme otherwise I'll have to do it in\\nthe background color yeah so we have\\ncolors.black but what if my weather\\nscreen or my weather app has more than\\njust one page do I have to go about and\\nchange the background color everywhere\\nremember our diagram\\nthe theme over here is going to set it\\nfor the entire app it's going to be the\\nglobal thing but for weather screen in\\nthe scaffold it's just going to be there\\nfor one particular page\\nand now you might be able to see the\\nresults but\\nit doesn't set it for the entire app\\nit's just for one screen so what I want\\nto do is go to the main dot dot set the\\ntheming up so I'm going to have theme\\ndata\\nand then you can pass in theme data but\\nwhat I want to do is use the preset\\nthemes given which is theme data dot doc\\nor light mode\\nyou can use either of them\\nor you can just Define your custom theme\\ndata\\nall of these work all right with custom\\ntheme data you can go and set your\\nbackground color you can set much more\\nstuff but that's not what I'm going to\\ndo I'm not going to start writing from\\nscratch I'm just going to use theme data\\ndot dot\\nwith Doc I have access to the dark\\nbackground you see but still this is\\ntheme data.doc and this is fine but I\\nwant to use material 3 because I like\\nthat very much so you see it has a named\\nproperty of use material 3.\\nI can pass and use material 3 and it\\nrequires a Boolean value so I can set it\\nto true\\nand it will start using material 3 and\\nyou see the background color over here\\nchanges now at if at all you want to\\nchange the background color what you can\\ndo is dot copy with and set your own\\ncustom stuff over here so it will have\\nthe dark color properties and\\nif you want to change anything at all\\nyou can change it with copy width\\nso let's say the Abba color over here is\\nblue it's not actually blue but let's\\nsay in theme data.doc the app bar color\\nis blue you want it to set it to White\\nyou can just go ahead and set the Abba\\ntheme over here\\nso what it will do is copy everything\\nfrom theme data.doc including app bar\\nthen it will see this copy with function\\nand it will override the existing app\\nbar theme with the app bar theme I\\nprovide over here\\nall right\\nso it just takes this and copies\\nwhatever is present inside of it with\\nthe existing theme data so I hope that\\nmakes sense it's quite intuitive but I\\ndon't want anything like that I just\\nwant this simple line to be present all\\nright now let's go to the weather screen\\nand designer app now what do I want the\\nfirst thing that I require is an app bar\\nso with me I have the iOS screenshot\\nhere now what I'm going to do is go over\\nit step by step and we'll see how to\\nmake this kind of UI if you want to try\\nit on your own go ahead try it it will\\nbe a good learning but if you can't\\nlet's design it on our own we'll get\\nsome practice and maybe after that you\\ncan start designing your own stuff\\nbecause this is going to have many\\nimportant widgets discovered\\nso the first thing that I require is an\\napp bar with a title weather app so we\\nare going to go ahead and have an app\\nbar pass in app bar maybe already seen\\nand you see as soon as I collab I have\\nto remove constant from here because\\nAbba isn't a constant you can see it\\ninside of here in the Constructor no\\ncons\\nnow we want the title which will be a\\nconstant text and we're going to call\\nthis let's say weather app let's go\\nahead and type it\\nsave it and we see whether operating\\nover here perfect\\nnow still the textile doesn't look very\\ngood because this is bolded so let's go\\nahead and set the textile Vilas Style\\ntextile\\nfont weight to be font weight dot bold\\nwe've seen exactly this and this is nice\\nthe next thing I want is a refresh\\nbutton over here also I want to make\\nsure that my title is always centered\\nirrespective of whether it is on Android\\nor iOS so I'm going to set Center title\\nto true\\ngreat no visible changes but on Android\\nyou'll see the change\\nnow the next thing I want is a refresh\\nicon over here\\nhow to add that now I told you in the\\nfirst app that whenever you want to add\\nany icons over here or any sort of\\nwidget we have to use the actions\\nproperty present inside of the app bar\\nso we are going to use exactly that we\\nare going to have actions and here we\\nare going to mention our icon which is\\ngoing to be icons dot refresh\\nAlso let's put a constable here save it\\nand we have our icon showing up\\nbut the problem with it is this icon is\\nnot clickable\\nyou know if I click on it it does\\nabsolutely nothing\\nI want to make sure that it still does\\nsomething whenever I click on it\\nso for that we'll need an on tap\\nproperty and like some sort of detector\\nthat hey this has been clicked so for\\nthis we need to use a button right\\nnot always you can use a button over\\nhere but sometimes you just don't want\\nto use a button what you want to use\\ninstead is an icon wrapped with\\na widget known as gesture detector so\\nyou can press Ctrl shift r on Mac and\\nthen you'll get these refactoring\\noptions and you can wrap with something\\nknown as a gesture detector\\nand gesture detector isn't a constant so\\nlet's remove it let's put const for our\\nicon\\nnow we'll put a comma so that the\\nformatting takes place and we get in a\\nformat like this\\nnow what I want to do is use some of the\\nproperty given by gesture detector which\\nis on tap\\nwith ontap we have access to the click\\nproperty so whenever we click on this\\nwe can run a particular function just\\nlike we do in a button so we can have\\nthe ontar property defined here and\\nlet's say print refresh\\nlet's save it press Ctrl command J\\nrestart an entire app let's click over\\nhere and it says refresh\\nagain if we click it says refresh so\\nthis is being clicked on but one problem\\nI have is there is no splash effect\\nlike when I click on it there should be\\nsome kind of radial Splash shown so for\\nthat kind of detection what I want to do\\nis wrap it with inquel Widget Inkwell\\nalso has\\nsimilar set of properties it doesn't\\nhave as advanced properties as a gesture\\ndetector it has lesser properties than\\ngesture detector but what Inkwell does\\nis give you a splash effect so when you\\nclick on this you get this nice Splash\\neffect\\nso you can use either of them\\nin this scenario and it will work fine\\nI'm going to go ahead with gesture\\ndetector and be done but\\nthere's another thing you can do instead\\nof using gesture detector and icon we\\nhave something known as an icon button\\nso\\nit is an icon and a button so it allows\\nyou to pass the on press property and an\\nicon so in our icon we are going to have\\nicon icons dot refresh\\nand then you have the on press property\\nso you can do the same task in multiple\\nways and you can have the same UI\\nit depends on you what you want to do\\nbut with icon button basically you have\\nthe nice cool Splash effect which is not\\na not a square it is a circle plus you\\nget the nice padding overall\\nin gesture detector and I can you would\\nhave to set your own padding property so\\nthat it didn't get stuck in the right\\nhand corner with icon button it provides\\nyou with\\nthe padding by itself cool now we are\\ndone with the Abba now let's get to the\\nbody and make some stuff so the first\\nthing I want to make is this big bulk\\nright here we're not going to actually\\nget some data as of right now we're\\ngoing to put in some false data here\\nand when we connect to an API which is\\nafter creating our UI\\nwe'll replace all the values but as of\\nright now\\nwe are going to put in random values so\\nlet's go ahead in our scaffold\\nwe are in a scaffold let's make sure\\nand then here we are going to pass a\\nbody property and in a body what do we\\nrequire well\\nfirst thing to analyze is the proper\\nlayout what is the layout of this app\\nwell everything is below one another in\\na vertical manner so obviously we need\\nto use columns so that we have access to\\nchildren and because of that we can put\\neverything inside of one\\nparticular widget\\nand it should be vertically below each\\nother\\nso let's go ahead and pass a column over\\nhere column will have children\\nand the first child is going to be this\\nmain card\\nso let's put a comment here saying main\\ncard so that we know what we need to\\nwork on\\nthen if you want you can put in a\\nplaceholder here saying that hey\\nthis much space is going to be given to\\nour\\nmain card\\nnow to change the height you know it's\\ntaking a lot of height maybe you can go\\nahead and change the properties here and\\nthe property I want to change is\\nfallback height so let's change it to\\nlet's say\\n250 and maybe it takes this much space\\nwhich is fine\\nand in the child we are going to pass in\\na constant text saying\\nmain card save it come over here you see\\nmain card but now the fallback height\\nand fallback width will disappear why\\nbecause you've said the child as a text\\nnow this parent will take only as much\\nheight and width as this text requires\\nas much as a child requires this is not\\nheight but fallback height fallback\\nheight is basically like hey you haven't\\nmentioned any child if you haven't\\nmentioned any child this is the height\\nwe are going to go to but if you have\\nmentioned a child we are going to take\\nas much speed as the child requires so\\nif we remove the child and come over\\nhere this looks great all right\\nnow after that the second thing we\\nrequire is where the forecast cards\\nwe need these cards over here right\\nso where the forecast cards again you\\ncan place a placeholder here\\nand let's say the fallback height is 150\\nlooks good enough maybe we need a sizing\\nwire so we'll have constant size box\\nheight 10 which will help us to leave\\nspacing we've already seen this before\\nbut this is two lesser space so let's go\\nahead and add 20 let's say this looks\\ngood and after that we'll have\\nadditional information so again we'll\\nleave some height\\nand then we'll have a placeholder again\\nlet's say 150 again\\nso this is the overall layout of our app\\nvery simply laid out first we are going\\nto have our main card then we are going\\nto have our weather forecast cards and\\nafter that\\nwe are going to have our additional\\ninformation\\nso let's get started by designing\\neverything\\nthe first thing we need to design is the\\nmain card so how is our main card going\\nto look like well let's analyze it\\nit does have a color of its own\\nit does have a 3d effect\\nit has its nice own curves\\nbecause if we just use a container which\\nwould be the first thing that goes in\\nour mind that hey this is a very big\\nthing and it has these curves\\nit has a color\\nit requires a children over here like we\\nwant to display a text we want to\\ndisplay an icon we want to display again\\na text\\nso the first thing that might come in\\nour mind is a container\\nbut it has an elevation and container\\ndoesn't have an elevation property so\\ndefinitely we cannot use a container\\nhowever what we can use is something\\nknown as a card widget so if we just use\\na card widget we'll be able to use it\\nnow as soon as you have a card you know\\none placeholder goes away but now let's\\nstart designing a car\\nin a card\\nwe require these three children\\nso we need degree Fahrenheit text we\\nneed this thing right here and we need\\ndrain\\nso in a card we are going to have a\\nchild property\\nwe are going to we are going to have a\\ncolumn and here we are going to mention\\nchildren obviously because everything in\\nis in a vertical format\\nso you want a column over here without\\ncolumn you won't get access to Children\\nyou can use row which will also give you\\naccess to children but it will be in a\\nhorizontal manner we don't want that\\nso we'll use column aware\\nnow we need text so we are going to pass\\nin a text and the text is going to be\\nlet's say\\n300 Fahrenheit now I also want access to\\ndegree\\nbut there's no degree sign on my\\nkeyboard at least what I can see so what\\nI'm going to do is go to Google search\\nfor degree symbol and just copy the\\ndegree from here\\nclose my Safari tab\\nhave 300 degree Fahrenheit like this and\\nwe see 300 degree Fahrenheit cool\\nlet's put a comma so that we have a\\nformatting in place\\nperfect\\nnow I want to design this further now\\nfirst of all let's go ahead and increase\\nthe font size and the font weight of our\\ntemperature so we're going to have style\\ntextile and the textile is going to be\\nfont size 32 font weight font weight dot\\nbull I want it bolded and this font size\\nis a tried and tested value I've built\\nthis app before so I know I want the\\nfont size of 32 but when I was building\\nthis app I constantly tried and see saw\\nwhat font size I preferred and this is\\nthe font size I prefer now if you look\\nclosely at it you'll see there's some\\nsort of background on it that is quite\\nevident and that is our card widget card\\ngives us access to an elevation stuff\\nwhich\\nyou can see over here\\nand you can toggle it on or off like if\\nyou want elevation to be zero it will be\\ncompletely gone but if you remove this\\nit has some sort of elevation of its own\\nnow we have a card but the problem right\\nnow is the card is not taking the\\nmaximum width it is only taking as much\\nof it as this text requires so what I\\ncan do is wrap my card with a container\\nwhich will tell it to take the maximum\\nwidth\\nso for this I'll press Ctrl shift R get\\nthe refactoring options and wrap it with\\ncontainer and here I'm going to mention\\nthe width which is going to be double\\ndot Infinity saying that hey take\\nmaximum amount of width and you see it\\ntakes the maximum amount of width\\nhowever we have a warning here I mean\\nthe entire app isn't warning but even\\nhere we have a warning saying use a size\\nbox to add white space to a layout so\\nwhenever you want to set up width as\\nI've already told you before you always\\nneed to use size box\\nwhen you have to use something more than\\njust a width or a height let's say color\\nborder radius all of those stuff you\\nhave to use container then but then\\nbut if it's only with then go ahead with\\nsize box\\nand we see the same thing\\nnow the width is stretched it takes the\\nmaximum amount of width possible so I\\nhope you are understanding how flutter\\nlayouts work\\nearlier we had not set any width\\nconstraints on this card\\nit was free to use whatever space it\\nrequired\\nand therefore it depended on its child\\nand its child was column columns width\\ndepends on its children and its child\\nrequired only this much space but then\\nwe added\\na constraint on our card saying that hey\\ntake the maximum amount of width\\npossible so it went ahead and took\\ndouble dot Infinity which has the\\nmaximum amount of space it can take\\nright\\nso keep this layout thing in mind\\nbecause it's the most important aspect\\nof flutter you need to understand how\\nlayout and UI work now the problem is\\nit's taking the maximum amount of space\\nI do want it to leave spacing from here\\nand if you see in a layout everything in\\nour column takes this amount of space so\\nI think on the column property they have\\nset the padding property padding is not\\nspecific to One widget that hey only\\nthis much only this widget requires\\nspacing from here not these widgets well\\nall of the widgets required the spacing\\nfrom here so we can safely assume that\\nwe can set the padding property on this\\ncolumn\\nnot on One widget of course you can go\\nahead and set padding property on every\\nwidget in our chat in our column but it\\nwould make much more sense to do it for\\nthe entire column so we can have Ctrl\\nshift R then we are going to wrap it\\nwith padding and we are going to set it\\nto let's say 16.\\nbecause it's much more than just eight\\nit would be somewhere over here and 16\\nis over here which looks good\\ngreat now you see there is spacing over\\nhere here everywhere that's good\\nnow let's put more children to our\\ncolumn we are going to have our icon now\\nso we are going to have icon icons Dot\\nCloud as of now it's going to be a\\nstatic value so let's put a cloud and\\nthe size is quite small so let's\\nincrease its size so we're going to have\\na size of 32\\nit's still small nothing big so let's go\\nahead with 48\\nstill quite small and let's go ahead\\nwith 64.\\nnow it looks big enough\\nso we can go ahead with this\\nalso if you want to increase the height\\nof your emulator you can do it by\\nstretching it then after this icon what\\nwe require is this subtext so let's put\\nthat you're going to have text\\ndrain\\nstyle is going to be let's say textile\\nfont size\\n16 let's go ahead with that\\nit's quite small what my thought process\\nis is like hey this is almost 32 then\\nthis is 64 and this is very small\\ncompared to both of these things so we\\ncan go ahead and let's say set the font\\nsize to 20 so it will look decent enough\\nin front of them\\nand I think that looks good so we have\\nthe content inside of the card setup\\nbut if you see there's much more spacing\\nover here\\nbetween these things so we can set that\\nup as well we are going to have a\\nconstant sized box of height 16 and\\ndon't worry about the errors if you are\\nconcerned about them because these\\nerrors will go away as soon as you put a\\nconst for example if I just put a\\nconstable here most of the errors just\\ngo away right\\nI am not putting them because\\nI know that later on I want to set a\\nborder radius property and Border radius\\nas you know border radius dot circular\\nis not a constant if it's not a constant\\nI cannot set it\\nto a constant right so instead of doing\\nand wasting time setting up cons what\\nI'm going to do is let the warnings be\\nthere\\nand wait for the Border radius property\\nto be set up so that we can put a nice\\ncurve over here\\nso we've put a size box over here this\\nleaves a good spacing we're going to do\\nthat again after the cloud icon that's\\nnice\\nnow if you compare it to this\\nin layout terms it looks quite similar\\nexcept\\nif you see over here there's pacing if\\nyou see over here there's spacing but\\nhere there is no spacing added over here\\nso there are two options we can take in\\nthe column we can set the size box over\\nhere\\nas the first child in a column and at\\nthe end again\\nor you can just wrap this column\\nproperty with\\npadding again\\nand this padding is limited only to our\\ncolumn so I'm going to go ahead with the\\ncolumn property because I don't like\\nputting size boxes where it's not\\nactually necessary so I'm going to go\\nahead and press Ctrl shift r\\nape it with padding and it's going to be\\nEdge and such dot all\\n16 save it come over here and this looks\\nbetter definitely\\nthe next thing I require is the\\nelevation to be bigger as you can see\\nthe Shadows are bigger so let's go ahead\\nand set our custom elevation property\\nfor our card which is going to be\\nelevation let's say 10. when we do that\\nthis is much stronger and appears more\\n3D it gives a better visual effect\\nthe next thing we want to do is\\nset a nice border radius it should be\\nmore curved than what we have right now\\nso in our card we can go ahead and set\\nthe shape property where it requires a\\nborder and here we can pass in a rounded\\nrectangular border what we've already\\nseen before right most of the widgets\\nare repeating we did learn a new thing\\nabout a card\\nbut rest of the things are quite similar\\nyou just need to understand what you\\nneed to do and start doing it for\\nyourself and you see as soon as I put\\ntrack rounded rectangular border and\\nsave it I get\\na pointy border because I need to custom\\nset my border radius over here so I'll\\ngo ahead and set my border radius to\\nborder radius\\ndot circular and as soon as I do border\\nradius dot circular the warnings should\\ngo away and here my border radius is\\ngoing to be 16 and as soon as I do that\\nlook there's more curve attached over\\nhere that looks perfect\\nthe warnings go away from here\\nhowever there are warnings over here so\\nlet's go ahead and put Constable let's\\nremove unnecessary cons\\nbecause their parent is a constant cool\\nso we have this thing over here it\\ndoesn't look very same to this\\nbut it does have the proper layout the\\nthing that we are missing is the nice\\nmerging filter between them right now\\nit's clearly visible that hey there's an\\nelevation property and doesn't merge\\nwith the background\\nto make it merge with the background\\nlike this we need to have access to One\\nwidget\\nwhich is\\na backdrop filter what backdrop filter\\nwill do is basically\\nblur the background in the X and Y\\ndirections so X will be the horizontal\\nDirection y will be the vertical\\nDirection think of it in graph and blur\\nthe background\\nand once it blurs the background you'll\\nhave a nice effect\\nlet's see what I'm talking about if I\\njust wrap my\\npadding Widget the column is wrapped by\\npadding and if we wrap the padding\\nwidget with\\nbackdrop filter we get access to the\\nnamed parameter of filter\\nand here we need to pass an image filter\\nso we need to pass an image filter and\\nif we do this much it's not allowed\\nbecause image filter is not an abstract\\nclass but it doesn't have a Constructor\\nof its own or actually\\nit is an abstract class and it doesn't\\nhave a Constructor of its own meaning\\nthis abstract class\\ncannot be extended you see\\nso having something like this image\\nfilter dot underscore and then\\nparenthesis basically means that this\\nCon the\\nConstructor of this abstract class\\ncannot be called any time\\nthat's why I said this is not an\\nabstract class it's it just has its\\nConstructor privatized\\nbut in reality this is an abstract class\\nwhose Constructor is also privatized you\\nknow privatized as always by underscore\\nso they've put an underscore over there\\nokay\\nso let's come back over here and use\\nimage filter dot because we know image\\nfilter is not extended if it's not\\nextended there can be no class we can\\nput here except image filter itself\\nthat's why I call Image filter Dot\\nnow if you didn't understand what I was\\ntalking about what I was saying is image\\nfilter is basically a privatized\\nConstructor so that means image filter\\ncannot be a parent class of any other\\nclass because extended is not allowed\\nso definitely I cannot put anything else\\nover here I need to put image filter\\nonly\\nso I called image filter Dot and that\\ngives us access to multiple methods we\\ncan use\\nyou can use blur compose dilate erode\\nI'm going to go ahead with blur that\\nwill blur my background\\nand here I can pass in Sigma X which\\nwill be let's say 10\\nand if you hover over this you see\\ncreates an image filter that applies a\\ngaussian blur and then we have Sigma Y\\nwhich is again going to be 10. so from\\nthe X and Y direction we want 10 and you\\nsee\\nit basically merges with the background\\nbut then its elevation kind of goes away\\nto prevent that we can add\\na border radius property to this\\nbackdrop filter itself\\nso you can press Ctrl shift R then wrap\\nit with a clip or rect widget which\\nallows you to put a border radius\\nproperty if you wrap it again with a\\ncard so that you can set up order radius\\nproperty it wouldn't make sense what you\\nneed to do is put clip rack what clip RX\\nwill do is clip it clip it according to\\nthe properties you mentioned and it\\nallows you to put border radius\\nand it also has a custom Clipper you can\\npass in but right now we just want to\\nput a border radius for that clip our\\nwrecked is enough so you can put border\\nradius\\nand Border radius is going to be the\\nsame thing as this one if it is\\ndifferent values it will look a bit\\nweird and you see as soon as we add\\nborder radius the elevation properties\\nthere and we get a nice cool effect\\nlooking like this card\\nso I hope you understand what I did over\\nhere I applied a backdrop filter because\\nof which everything was leveled into one\\nplace and there was blur over here then\\nI wrapped it with a clip rack widget\\nbecause of which it applied its own\\nborder radius it separated the blur\\nfrom the background and gave it a nice\\nlook\\nso we have a nice little\\nbackdrop filter as well as the Border\\nradius which looks exactly like this\\nwidget now I know this is an important\\nor a difficult concept to grasp but you\\ncan play around with yourself you know\\nyou can just remove this widget again\\nand see how it looks after adding lip RX\\nwidget you'll again see how it looks\\ngreat so we have our main card design\\nangle and in my opinion it looks just\\nperfect\\nnow let's go ahead and design the\\nweather forecast and additional\\ninformation tabs\\nso for weather forecast we have to leave\\nsome spacing which we've already done I\\nassume here we have it\\nsize box height 20\\nafter that I need a text saying weather\\nforecast\\nso I'm going to have a constant text\\nsaying whether for cast\\nsave it and when you have an error and\\nyou save it\\nit doesn't hot reload but when you save\\nit after no errors you see where the\\nforecast over here\\nnow let's put style over here we are\\ngoing to have style as textile then we\\nare going to have font size as 24 which\\nis a big value then font weight which is\\ngoing to be font weight dot bold\\nand we have our weather forecast showing\\nup over here which looks good\\nnow what I want to do is it is mentioned\\nin the center I want to take it to the\\nleft hand side so for that I can wrap my\\ntext widget\\nin a widget known as align\\nwhat align does is basically certain\\nalignment of where you want it to be in\\nthe column do you want it in the left\\nview do you want it in the center you\\nwant it in the right top right whatever\\nand align has alignment property now\\ninstead of using a line you can go ahead\\nand use container which also has an\\nalignment property but at the end of the\\nday container inside uses alignment\\nor align widget which is the same thing\\nso let's go ahead and pass alignment\\nnow alignment requires alignment\\ngeometry but its default value is\\nalignment Dot Center we can set it to a\\ndifferent value by using alignment Dot\\nand you see we have a bunch of options\\nbottom center bottom left bottom right\\ncenter Center left center right top\\nCenter top left top right what I want to\\ndo is\\nCenter in the left hand side\\nso I'm going to use Center left save it\\nand we have it displayed over here\\nnow instead of doing this alignment Dot\\nCenter left what you could do is\\nremove the Align widget go to your\\ncolumn\\nthis column not this column that we have\\nover here this column is related to\\nthese things over here we want to go to\\nthe column that controls all of these\\nthings\\nand here set the cross access alignment\\nto cross access alignment dot start as\\nsoon as you do that everything starts\\nfrom the left hand side\\nfrom here\\nso as I've already mentioned before and\\nI'll do it again if you've forgotten\\nmain axis is this thing right over here\\nand cross axis is everything from year\\nto year\\nso when we set cross access alignment\\ndot start everything starts from here if\\nI set it to cross access alignment dot\\nend everything from will start from here\\nokay\\nthe difference between using a line\\nwidget over here and using cross access\\nalignment is this cross access alignment\\nwill set it for all the descending\\nwidgets for these cards that we'll\\ndisplay for additional information for\\nthese things over here but\\nalign only sets it for one particular\\nwidget in our case that was the weather\\nforecast widget\\ncool\\nso let's go down we have our weather\\nforecast looks good\\nnow we are going to have our size box\\nagain so we are going to set a size box\\nof height 20 again\\nsave it\\nthen what we want is a list of widgets\\nshowing up over here and how this works\\nis\\nsomething like this this is scroll level\\nokay because there are more than\\nthree things that we want to display on\\nthe screen together and we still want to\\ndisplay more stuff\\nso it is scrollable over here so I want\\nthat scrollable thing to be present how\\ncan I do that well I can put a row that\\nwould be good\\nand inside of the row I can display\\nthese cards that sounds good so let's go\\nahead and create a row\\nin our row we are going to have children\\nand my first child is going to be well\\nthis thing over here\\nso I have to design this component on my\\nown\\nso let's go ahead and Design This so we\\nare going to have well again a card\\nbecause it has an elevation and this\\nsort of looks like a card only just like\\nwe had before right it has elevation of\\nits own so it gives like a\\n3D visual it's coming on the top of your\\nscreen and that is what a card is so we\\ncan use a card again\\nthen we can use a child\\nand the child is going to have\\nwell a column directly which shows a\\nTime the cloud icon again and the\\ntemperature\\nso we're going to have our child\\ncolumn\\nthen children and the first child is the\\ntime so my time is let's say zero three\\nzero zero\\nlet's save it come over here and we see\\nthis perfect\\nbut the problem right now\\nis my card only taking as much width as\\nmy text require and definitely my text\\nis not going to require this much space\\nso what I can do is set a custom height\\nor width again so I'm going to wrap my\\ncard widget with\\na size box again where I'll set a custom\\nwidth to let's say 100 save it come over\\nhere and this looks bigger nice\\nnow after this text we are going to have\\na sized box\\nbut even before that let's go ahead and\\nset the properties of this text this\\ntext is bigger in size than this thing\\nright here and it's also bolded so we\\nneed to set two properties inside of the\\nstyle and we've done this so many times\\nI hope you can do this on your own in\\nthe textile we are going to have font\\nsize\\nand the font size is 16. font weight and\\nthe font weight is fontway dot bull save\\nit come away and this looks good\\nnow after this we leave our space again\\nso we have constant\\nsize\\nbox\\nand then we have our height set to 8 we\\nleave 8 spacing\\nand after that we need a cloud icon\\nagain so we have icon icons dot cloud\\nand the size is let's say 32.\\nsave it and we'll have a cloud icon if\\nwe remove the size icon and just display\\nit it's quite small and since I know\\nit's small I set it to 32 but it really\\nall depends on how you want it to look\\nit can look a different and you'll be\\nfine with it but I like this look better\\nI'm trying to replicate what I just\\ncreated over here\\nin our third app we're going to design a\\ndribble UI\\nso you'll understand how to create one\\nspecific UI but this weather page is\\nyour own creativity so you can just do\\nwhatever you want I'm going to follow\\nthis kind of design\\nagain we use a spacing and to be\\nconsistent with what we used above I'm\\njust going to copy paste my size box\\nand then we are going to use the\\ntemperature so I'm going to copy this\\ntext now paste it over here and let's\\nsay my temperature is\\n320\\nsave it\\nand this is bolded I don't want it\\nboldered\\nAlso let's put decimal aware 320.12\\nlet's remove bold save it\\nand it's quite big if you can see over\\nhere closely look at it this text is\\nbigger than this text\\nwhy it's not because it's bolded it's\\nbecause its font size is bigger so we\\nneed to reduce its font size let's try\\nto remove this textiles totally\\nand then we are able to match it this\\nlooks better in my opinion\\nall right so I'm going to use this\\nnow after this\\num\\nI do want padding to be present just\\nlike we had in this card it's a total\\nreplica if you want to call that so\\nlet's go ahead and wrap our column with\\na padding property so we are going to\\nhave\\nour column wrapped with\\npadding and padding is going to have\\nEdge in search dot all it save it and\\nyou'd see it right over here looks good\\nand this looks just like how this looks\\nalso the elevation is kind of small I\\njust realized so let's\\nincrease the elevation as well to six\\nthen it looks much better and much\\nsimilar to what we have already\\nand one last thing that is there is the\\nBorder radius this border radius is more\\ncurved and this is slightly less curved\\nso we want to set a border radius on\\nthis card\\nso we can either wrap the padding widget\\nwith a clip or Rec widget again so that\\nwe have the nice padding or we can just\\nremove this padding and wrap it with\\ncontainer then you pass a border radius\\nproperty to it now container doesn't\\nhave a border radius property mentioned\\nover here you can check for yourself\\nbut what it does have is decoration and\\nwhat it requires is box decoration\\nit requires just a decoration but if you\\ntry to create just a decoration that's\\nnot allowed because it's an abstract\\nclass what you can use instead is box\\ndecoration and we've seen this class\\nbefore where in\\nCupertino design when we were trying to\\ndesign something we had to pass in\\ndecoration\\nremember the text field that we add\\nCupertino text field that had a\\ndecoration or a style property that\\nrequired box decoration and we passed in\\nbox decoration that's exactly what we\\nneed to pass in over here and then we\\ncan pass in the Border radius which has\\nabout radius dot circular\\nto let's say 12 or 10 or 16 whatever you\\nwant\\ntry test it on your own just see what\\nyou like and use it don't blindly follow\\nwhat I'm following\\nbecause you're building an app for\\nyourself you want it to look how you\\nthink it should look so this looks more\\ncurved now and that's good\\nhowever this card doesn't look as good\\nas this one why\\nbecause if you'll see\\nthis text has more padding\\nand you can increase the padding over\\nhere let's go ahead and set it to let's\\nsay 18. save it and you have more\\npadding but it still doesn't feel as\\ngood the reason for that is quite simple\\nwe have set a restriction over here that\\nyour width should be 100 no matter what\\nthe width should be 100 for the card now\\nif I remove this\\nand you know let's set it back to 12\\nagain\\nwe have a card looking like this and it\\ndoesn't look very good\\nthat's why we had set the size box to a\\ncard in the first place\\nbut even with that\\nwe are just saying that hey the card\\nshould have a width of 100 that's not\\nwhat we want\\nbecause then we are limiting the height\\nof the card what I want to do is set the\\ncontent inside of it to have a width of\\n100 so what I'm going to do is wrap this\\ncolumn with a width and since we already\\nhave a container we don't have to wrap\\nit with the size box we can just mention\\nthe width property over here and set it\\n200.\\nand once we do that you see this card\\nlooks much better than we what we had\\nbefore\\nother problem that I have right now is\\nthere's too much spacing over here that\\nthis card feels disconnected from\\nweather forecast it doesn't feel that\\nthis is a better forecast it just feels\\nlike this is a thing of its own so let's\\nreduce the size box height over here\\nlet's set it to 16.\\nand then it looks much better otherwise\\nit just feels disconnected from where\\nthe forecast text\\nsimple now what we want to do is take\\nthis card and paste it five times right\\nso we can have one two three four five\\nsave it\\nand we have the cards showing up nicely\\nbut the problem is\\nthey are exceeding the limit of the\\nscreen obviously\\nwhy wouldn't they exceed the limit of\\nthe screen we only have space for 4.5\\nor 3.5 cards plus we have a padding\\nproperty over here which restricts it\\neven more right we have\\nover here in the top of the column\\npadding\\nagencies.all 16. so we are leaving a\\npadding of 16 from here because of which\\nour cards can only come till here so\\nthat's why we had this now how can I\\nmake these\\ncards not these cards this entire row\\nscroll level so for that we have a\\nwidget we can just press Ctrl shift R\\nthen we'll have rapid widget and we have\\na widget known as single child scroll\\nView\\nwhen we use this widget whatever child\\nwe have inside of this is scrollable and\\nwhen we save it\\nyou see it's not really scrollable even\\nafter hot restarting and that's because\\nit has a direction of its own it is\\nscrollable only in the vertical\\nDirection but not in the horizontal\\nDirection so we can change its scroll\\nDirection over here so we have scroll\\nDirection access dot horizontal and once\\nwe do that the error goes away and this\\nthing right here is scrollable\\nso with single child scroll view you're\\nbasically telling that hey whatever\\nwidget you have and it exceeds a certain\\nwidth\\nor a certain size you can wrap it with\\nsingle child scroll View and it will\\nmake the entire screen scrollable\\nand that's quite convenient\\nand this is single child scroll view\\nbecause it only has one child and its\\none child is a row\\nnow if you want multiple\\nchild scroll view you can look for\\nmulti-child scroll view but there's\\nnothing like it because most of the\\ntimes you'll only need a single child\\nscroll view because then you can pass in\\na child and then your row column widgets\\nwhatever you want\\nokay\\nso let's go down and we have our stuff\\nover here but you'll see we have to\\nscroll much below just to see one card\\nwidget and since we are used reusing the\\nsame card everywhere\\nit causes a problem for us\\nwhat problem let's say I want to change\\nthe size of this icon I change I want to\\nchange it to let's say 40. I want to\\nmake it look bigger\\nnow what happens is\\nwhen I change it over here I only change\\nit for one card I have to change it for\\nall the other cards\\nso I'll have to go ahead copy this for T\\npaste it over here over\\nhere over\\nhere and there's a possibility I miss\\nout on something\\nalso since you have warnings I want to\\nmake sure that everything is constant\\nover here so the warnings go away so I\\nhave to manually do it for every single\\ncard\\nnow that's not suitable is it\\nso what I can do is extract this widget\\nout of here also press command Z to set\\nit back to the original height because\\nthis size 32 is perfect for me\\nso coming back to what I was talking\\nwhat I can do is extract this card\\nwidget into a separate class of its own\\nthat way I can just return\\nOne widget and I have a single source of\\ncontrol if I want to change how a cloud\\nlooks I can change it in one particular\\nwidget itself I don't have to go ahead\\nand change it every single place just\\nlike we did in Border remember when we\\nhad our currency converter material page\\nand we had a border for our text field\\nwe made a variable that made sure\\nthat you can have it over here\\nnow what I'm going to do is instead of\\ncreating a variable I'm going to create\\na particular widget of its own so that I\\ncan store it\\nso what I'm going to do is take this\\ncard\\ncontrol X\\nthen go outside of this class and create\\na stateless widget\\nlet's go outside of this class not\\ninside of this class here we are going\\nto create stateless widget\\nand then we are going to call this\\nwidget\\nearly\\nforecast\\nitem all right this is what I'm going to\\ncall it why because it shows me the\\nforecast for every r as simple\\nnow\\nI can copy this card I think I already\\ncopied it but let's just do it again\\nlet's return a card from here then put a\\nconstant Also let's remove the\\nunnecessary constant from size box\\nbecause their parent is a constant\\nitself\\nnow we can take this early forecast item\\ninstead of returning a card I'm going to\\nreturn Ali forecast item\\ninstead of returning a card again I'm\\ngoing to return an Ali forecast item\\nlet's copy this\\nagain instead of returning a card Ali\\nforecast item instead of returning a\\ncard\\nhourly forecast item\\nso we have our four hourly forecast\\nitems we are missing one let's put\\nanother one so we have five cards\\nperfect\\nso we have our layout done for this as\\nwell then next thing is the last section\\nthe additional information section so\\nsimilarly we are going to remove this\\nplaceholder now no need for that we\\nalready have that the last thing is this\\nadditional information we're going to\\nleave a size box of height 20\\nAlso let's put a cons for the entire\\nsingle child scroll View\\nno errors now you see perfect then we\\nneed a text again which has the same\\nheight as the weather forecast so I'm\\ngoing to copy paste it\\nand call this additional\\ninformation\\nsave it come back over here and there we\\nhave it now I challenge you to make this\\non your own we have sufficient knowledge\\nof what we need to do do you have to use\\na card do you have to use something else\\nyou have your own knowledge for this so\\ngo ahead and try it out on your own and\\nlet me know in the comment section if\\nyou were able to do it\\nnow your code doesn't have to match mine\\nif it looks similar then it's all good\\nif it doesn't\\nthen maybe you can copy my code however\\nit's always good that you try it on your\\nown\\nso let's go ahead and create first of\\nall a row\\nand even before that let's put a height\\nover here\\nconstant size box height 16 and after\\nthat I'm going to have a row where we\\nare going to have children and the first\\nchild is going to be\\nour first additional information item\\nwhich is this thing right here so\\nsince they are vertically laid out I am\\njust going to put in a column so we have\\na column\\nin our column we have children in our\\nchildren we have an icon at first\\nand the icon is icons Dot\\nand this is kind of like\\na drop icon\\nso let's search for something icons dot\\nwater water is kind of like a wave so\\nlet's put drop\\nthere's nothing like Drop maybe water\\ndrop and we have water drop exactly like\\nthis thing okay cool\\nso we have our icon over here and what\\nI'm going to do is make sure my icon is\\nas big as this icon there's consistency\\nin our UI which is good so we are going\\nto have a size of 32 which increases its\\nheight\\nthen we are going to leave some spacing\\nagain constant size box height eight\\nagain consistency even here we had a\\nspacing of eight same thing we are doing\\nthen we have our text which says what's\\nthe\\nlabel for this so like what is the thing\\nwe are showing we're showing humidity\\nso let's have that\\nsave it\\nlooks good enough\\nif we just scroll this back to the\\nnormal\\nthing yeah I think they're pretty much\\nthe same after this we can again leave a\\nheight\\nand then we need\\nthe value like what's the value of this\\nhumidity let's go ahead with 91\\nproduct\\ntext\\nthen we need a style and this is\\ndefinitely bigger so we just want to\\nleave textile\\nfont size 16 save it 91.\\nbut this is not bolded so let's go ahead\\nand bold it now you understand what I'm\\ndoing it's the same thing we are doing\\nrepeatedly because these are a very few\\nwidgets that continuously keep repeating\\nrow column icon text\\nicon button gesture detector Inkwell\\ncontainer size box you know same things\\nkeep repeating for 90 of the uis things\\nlike backdrop filter come once in a\\nwhile\\nso you don't have to worry about\\nthose kind of widgets okay so we have\\nhumidity over here and again the same\\nlogic\\nif I want to change the design of\\nthis thing I'll have to\\nchange it three different times if I\\npaste it like this you know since I want\\nthree columns over here I'll have to\\nkeep pasting it again and again\\nso instead what I can do is put it in a\\nwidget of its own\\nand I can do it right over here but the\\nproblem I'm facing right now is I can\\nstack everything up in one single file\\nbut does that make sense if I put\\neverything in one file not really\\nso I'm going to put everything in\\ndifferent files all right so I'm going\\nto go to the left folder I have whether\\nforecast item dot dot import\\nflutter material dot over here then I'm\\ngoing to paste it\\nAli forecast item not weather forecast\\nso let me rename this\\nto\\nearly forecast item good naming is a\\nmust when it comes to programming just\\nlike variables\\nthen we can press command full stop it\\ntells us to import Ali forecast item\\nlet's do that save it then we can copy\\nthis\\ncolumn make sure you copy this entire\\ncolumn\\nand we can create a widget of its own\\nnow there's a trick you can do instead\\nof creating it on yourself you can press\\nCtrl shift r\\nthen you say extract widget give the\\nwidget its name the name of this widget\\nis going to be additional\\ninfo item\\nnot N4 info item and you see it creates\\na widget by itself\\nit also automatically puts additional\\ninfo item over here let's put a const\\nlet's remove size box from here\\nsave it and we'll take this in a\\nseparate file of its own again so we\\nhave additional\\ninfo\\nitem dot dot we can import flutter\\nnot physics dot dot material dot dot now\\nyou might say hey this is quite\\nredundant and why do you have to\\ncontinuously keep doing it well that's\\nbecause when more Engineers are working\\nsegregation of files and having one\\nparticular component in one file will\\nmake much more sense than having\\neverything stuck together in one file\\nwhat would happen if I just stuck\\neverything in just main.dot file it\\nwasn't a good thing\\nso I'm sticking everything in one\\nparticle of\\nfile of its own\\nnow let's import this thing right here\\nby pressing command full stop again\\nand let's put additional info item three\\ntimes\\ncool now the problem here is everything\\nis stuck together so do I have to add a\\npadding widget not exactly because\\npadding widget will\\nnot make sure that they are spaced out\\nevenly if you see aware everything is\\nspaced out evenly\\nwhat can I do such that just paste\\nevenly so for that row gives us a\\nproperty in its mean access alignment\\nwhich we then discuss remember we add\\nmain access alignment Dot and we add a\\nbunch of options over here Center was\\nbasically centering everything end was\\nbasically taking everything to the end\\nstart was\\nputting everything to the start but\\nthere were three options that we didn't\\ntalk about space around space between\\nspace evenly because those required you\\nto have multiple components and in our\\napp\\nin our first app we didn't have those\\ncomponents\\nand when we did have those components\\nlike text text field and button I forgot\\nto mention it so here I'm mentioning it\\nand this same thing is even there for\\nour column all right\\nwe'll take a look after we take a look\\nat this main access alignment properties\\nso first option we have is space around\\nwhat happens in space around is you tell\\nit to space around each and everything\\nso there's space away or space over here\\nthen for this widget also space away\\nyour space aware\\nthen for this widget also space away or\\nspace away up\\nto use space\\naround all of the widgets what happens\\nin space between is\\neverything\\nis spaced between those widgets it's not\\naround it's not happening in both the\\ndirection the space is not being left\\nfrom here and your both it's only being\\nleft from here\\nhere\\nso it's around\\nso for the starting widget it's going to\\nbe only here for the middle widget is\\ngoing to be year and year and for the\\nending widget it's only going to be from\\nhere that's what space around is\\nor space between us\\nspace around says to leave space around\\neverything space between says that hey\\nleave space between everything I hope\\nEnglish makes sense you know\\nit's all in the English and then we have\\nspace evenly what we require\\nit spaces evenly everything but to be\\nhonest face evenly doesn't look as good\\nas space around so I'm just going to\\nkeep space around all right\\nnow you can use space evenly if you like\\nthat design I like this much better\\nbecause there's much more spacing and\\nmuch more clarity now the benefit of\\nusing main axis alignment and not using\\npadding is if I have four widget let's\\nsay it automatically adjusts\\nI don't have to add a padding to the\\nfourth widget over here if I have a\\nfifth widget\\nyou see it automatically adjusts\\naccording to the conditions that's the\\ngood thing about it\\nbut anyways I only need three things\\ngreat so I have our entire UI created\\nand it looks awesome in my opinion but\\nif you see additional information\\ndoesn't have that much of height over\\nhere this does have so you can reduce it\\nto Heights to let's say eight and this\\nwill look better also for weather\\nforecast if you want to\\ndecrement this size you can go ahead and\\ndecrement that let's say put 8\\nand that will look better for you\\nso yeah this is our UI design perfect\\nnow to show you the column thing that I\\nwas talking about column has the same\\nmain access alignment properties if you\\nhave main access alignment dot start or\\ndot space around let's say everything is\\nspaced around in the entire screen first\\nwidget over here then spacing so that\\nspace around\\nagain space around so this space around\\nevery single widget here\\nif we have space between\\nthe space between all of the widgets and\\nit looks quite similar to space around\\nthen we have space evenly\\nthis also looks quite similar but there\\nis some change\\nso my point is you have the same stuff\\nyou can do in Center everything gets\\ncentered but for me I want the default\\noption of main access alignment dot\\nstart because that looks perfect\\ngreat\\nwhat I want to do is make sure that\\neverything can have a different value of\\nits own right now what we are doing is\\nsaying that hey additional info item is\\ngoing to have\\nhumidity text it's going to have the\\nwater drop icon is going to have this\\nconstant text whenever you initialize\\nadditional info item these are the\\nthings that get created\\nunlike the design over here I cannot put\\nwind speed I cannot put pressure I\\ncannot put all of that stuff\\nbecause whenever I create this widget we\\nhave this stuff displaying\\nSo to avoid that what I can do is take\\neverything here from The Constructor\\nwhy because every time you initialize 10\\nyou ask what the icon should be what the\\nlabel should be what the value should be\\nand that's exactly what we want we want\\ndifferent items for every time we create\\nan additional info item so let's go\\nahead and create a Constructor how do we\\ncreate a Constructor now\\nwell first of all we Mark every widget a\\nfinal because\\nit's a widget right and widget are\\nimmutable especially stateless widget\\nand even stateful widgets are immutable\\nall widgets are immutable so we need to\\nhave final for all our properties so\\nwe're going to have final I can data\\nbecause I can requires icon data\\nthen we are going to ask for the icon\\nand we are not going to initialize\\nanything because if we initialize then\\nwe are itself giving it a value so it\\ndoesn't make sense to put it over here\\nwe can just put it over here we need to\\nask it from The Constructor so we are\\ngoing to have required because this is a\\nnamed argument we have learned it in Dot\\nrequired this dot icon now I can take\\nthis icon and pass it over here now you\\nsee we get an error over here saying\\nthat whenever you initialize additional\\ninfo item you need to pass your own icon\\nwe get an error over here also saying\\nthat hey you cannot put a const\\nbecause this is coming from the\\nConstructor and the value from The\\nConstructor can change\\nso this cannot be a constant it's a\\ndynamic value so let's put constant for\\nthe size box\\nnow even for this text we need to take\\nit from the\\nConstructor itself so let's take final\\nstring label\\nthen we have required this dot label so\\nI can ask for label over here\\nagain this is dynamic so text constant\\nis not required\\nso any value that is coming from the\\nConstructor\\ncannot be a constant\\nthen we need a value text so we have y\\nnull string value required this dot\\nvalue\\nnow I can take this value and paste it\\nover here\\nso text\\nstring value is not is a is a\\nnon-constant but textile can still be a\\nconstant right\\nso we can put a constant over here\\nsimple\\nand now with this we have access\\nto all of these properties over here so\\nevery time you initialize additional\\ninfo item you need to pass in these\\nparticular properties so let's go ahead\\nand pass icons dot water drop as the\\nfirst icon because our first thing is\\ngoing to be humidity\\nthen our label which is going to be your\\nmidday\\nand then finally the value which is\\ngoing to be\\nlet's say in 91.\\nand when we come over here well the\\nerror gets a result now we need to do it\\ntwo more times so our icon here label\\nhere and value here is required now what\\nis our label\\nwind speed so let's go ahead and type\\nwind speed the icon for it is going to\\nbe icons dot air because\\nthat's what wind is\\nand then we are going to have\\nseven point\\nfive let's say\\nthen again we have to mention I can\\nlabel\\nvalue\\nso my value here is going to be let's\\nsay 1000\\npressure\\nand I didn't find any particular icon\\nfor pressure\\nso what I did was go ahead and use icons\\nDot\\nBeach\\nsince I didn't find it if you have\\nanything related to pressure you can use\\nthat but I like this much better\\nso you see everything has its own value\\nnow same thing we are going to do with\\nthe weather forecast as well\\nhere in our Ali forecast item you'll see\\nevery time we initialize it gets its own\\nstatic values we need to pass it from\\nThe Constructor so that the values can\\nchange every time we initialize so do\\nthe exact same thing\\npause the video try it on your own and I\\nhope you're able to do it if you're able\\nto do it then congrats you've understood\\nthe entire concept if you're not then\\nmaybe you need to re-watch the entire\\nthing\\nso I hope you were able to do it let's\\ngo ahead and try it on your own and\\nearly forecast icon item the first thing\\nwe require is final string\\ntime\\nthen we need final\\nstring temperature\\nthen final icon data icon\\nnow we need to mention required for all\\nbut I have a trick for you you can press\\nthis bulb icon add final field\\nparameters and it automatically adds\\nrequired Arguments for you\\ngreat saves a lot of time for us let's\\ngo to the Ali forecast item and mention\\nit so we need to mention time time is\\nlet's say 0 0 first\\nthen we have\\nicon\\nit will be icons dot let's say it's\\ncloud\\nbecause it's raining\\nthen the\\ntemperature is going to be\\nwhat's the temperature over here\\n301.22 let's save it I'm going to paste\\nit four more times so one two three four\\nlet's remove them\\nso this will be 0 3 let's call it sunny\\nand let's say it's\\n275\\nI hope 275 degree Fahrenheit is sunny\\nand I think\\nif I think about it 275 degrees\\nFahrenheit is quite a lot of\\nheat it's more than 100 degree celsius\\nso we are making a mistake here instead\\nof 300 degree Fahrenheit we need 300\\nKelvin that's what the correct thing is\\nso I apologize and I know you might be\\nthinking\\nall the time that hey this is incorrect\\nit's not actually in degree Fahrenheit\\nit's actually in kelvin I misinterpreted\\nit so my bad so anyways uh let's go back\\nto our stuff 275 is not at all Sunny so\\nlet's go ahead with\\n300.52\\nthen 301.22 then\\n302.22 let's call this sunny again\\nwe have\\n300.12 and finally\\n304.12\\nthen also change the time zero three\\nzero six\\nzero nine\\nand twelve\\nso yeah we are able to change everything\\nlet's also put\\neverything over here so time over here\\nis going to be time\\nI can here is going to be icon and\\nthe text here is going to be temperature\\nconstant\\nlet's put everywhere\\nconstant now if you're wondering how I\\nselected multiple cursors at a time I\\ndid that by pressing option so when you\\nselect one place put option on another\\nput option on another and then you're\\nable to do it that's how I do it on Mac\\nI'm not sure about Windows but you can\\nGoogle it\\nokay now let's restart it and there we\\nhave it\\nthat's our app perfect now again I\\napologize and you know I had been\\nthinking it wrong it's not actually\\ndegree Fahrenheit it's Kelvin because it\\nmakes more sense degree Fahrenheit would\\nmean that this is like over 100 degrees\\nCelsius and that just doesn't make sense\\nright so this is Kelvin which basically\\nmeans that it's 27 degrees Celsius\\nAlso let's correct the spelling of\\nhumidity there\\nOkay cool so yeah we are done with the\\nbasic structure of the app now the next\\nthing is to get data from API\\nfrom the web so that I can display it on\\nmy screen real time\\nand we also need proper loading\\nindicators we need proper error\\nindicators all of those stuff so let's\\ngo ahead and set it up so to get the\\nreal-time data we need access to an API\\nand to call an API we will need the HTTP\\npackage we've already seen that in the\\ndart section\\nso let's go ahead and install the HTTP\\nPlugin or package to our flutter code in\\ndot pad it was available for us but here\\nin flutter when we are on our local\\nsystem we have to install it so we need\\nto go to pubspect.aml in the\\ndependencies section we need to add that\\ndependency\\nAlso let's get the HTTP version now\\nwe have pub.dev packages HTTP where you\\ncan find the HTTP Plugin or a package\\nthen you can just copy it paste it over\\nhere save it and then it will run\\nflutter pop get command flood up up get\\ncommand gets all the dependencies all of\\nthe things that are mentioned over here\\nwe'll see fonts assets everything\\nand then it refreshes our project\\nnow we'll be able to use the HTTP plugin\\nin our code so let's go ahead right at\\nthe top and we are going to create our\\nfunction over here and that is going to\\nreturn a future\\nand let's call this function get current\\nweather\\nwe can Define functions in a stateless\\nwidget that's not not allowed you can\\ndefinitely do it so let's put async over\\nand we already know how to put HTTP\\ncalls it's all given over here first\\nthing is to import it and\\nto refresh your memory as HTTP is given\\nyou because\\nwe don't want to call just get function\\nlike this which is present in http.dot\\nfile which you can come over here and\\nsee\\nso we are using HTTP dot get\\nthis makes it easy then it requires\\nsomething known as an URI and\\nto pass a URI you can just do uri.parse\\nor UI dot https\\neither of them work but I'm going to go\\nahead with uri.pass because I already\\nhave the URL it's going to give me\\nnow if you're wondering what URI is URI\\nstands for uniform resource identifier\\nURL stands for uniform resource locator\\nthe difference between URI and URL is\\nthat URL is a subtype of URI URI has a\\nparticular scheme which is followed by\\nURL as well\\nbut URI is like a bigger set and URL is\\na subset of it\\nso let's go ahead and pass our URL here\\nand\\nhow do we get our URL\\nwell to get it we have to access the API\\nand the API we're going to use is given\\nby open weather map in dot section we\\nare to use Json placeholder that was\\njust a dummy and a fake mock API all\\nright this is the real API it's giving\\nus real data\\nso what will be the temperature in\\nLondon Mumbai England New York\\nEtc so how do we get access to its API\\nwell first of all I'd like to mention\\nthat there are multiple websites that\\noffer apis for weather but I like open\\nWeather the best because it offers a\\nfree API that everyone can use it also\\nhas a paid version for\\nadvanced stuff but for us\\nthe free API is enough all right\\nso what you need to do is go ahead click\\non sign in then you need to create an\\naccount first so let's go ahead and\\ncreate an account my name is I'll enter\\nmy email password repeat password click\\non these two things and the captcha and\\ncreate an account\\nand I'll see you after I do these steps\\nso I'll check my email I'll confirm it\\nand you see they've sent a verification\\nemail then just click on verify your\\nemail\\nand this email address has been\\nsuccessfully confirmed\\nnow what we need to do is wait for\\nanother email open whether team will\\nsend us which will contain our API key\\nit will contain the URL we can use for\\nfree in our projects so let's wait for\\nit or if you don't want to wait for it\\nyou can click over here my API keys and\\nyou'll see your API key don't use mine\\nbecause I'm just going to deactivate\\nthis after this tutorial kindly use your\\nown API key and you'll also see over\\nhere that the email has arrived and it\\ncontains my API key\\nand it says within the next couple of\\nhours it will be activated and ready to\\nuse if I use it right now there's a\\npossibility that I won't be able to use\\nit and it will give me an error however\\nI can do it later on and I can also\\ncreate more API keys on my account page\\nwhich we've already seen over here I can\\ngenerate more API keys\\nand\\nit says to always use the API key in\\neach API call now you might ask hey why\\ndo we need API key\\nthe Json placeholder didn't have API key\\nright well it didn't have it because it\\nwas a mocked data it was a dummy data it\\ndoesn't have any real value\\nbut this is real-time data it contains\\nactual data\\nof the weather\\nand\\nsome user\\nmight call this API like a hundred\\nthousand times a million times by just\\nusing a simple for Loop that means the\\nAPI will be called a million times so\\nthat will cost the company\\na lot\\nand the company obviously doesn't want\\nthat\\nthat's why API keys are there so that\\nthey can authenticate you\\nthey know that it's you who are using\\nand they can put trade limits to how\\nmuch\\ntimes you can call it for our URL over\\nhere we have I think\\n1000 free API calls and after that it\\nwill stop working for us\\nso let's go ahead copy this URL\\nput https colon slash slash\\nput this thing over here\\nand save it\\nlet's break the this URL down and see\\nwhat all it contains first one https\\nwhich I had to add then API dot\\nopenweathermap.org slash data 2.5 this\\nis like their model if you're familiar\\nwith chart GPD\\nit also is\\nworking on certain models right it is\\nworking on 3.5 model\\nthis is the 2.5 model open weather maps\\n2.5 model\\nthe three model is\\na subscribe version\\nI'll show it to you over here if you go\\nto\\nopen Weather API\\nyou see one call Api 3.0\\nand it has minute forecast Ali forecast\\ndaily forecast it has a lot more stuff\\nthan a simple API cool then we have\\nweather because we want the weather\\nyou're just having the path then you\\nhave question mark Q is equal to London\\nmost of the interesting stuff happens\\nafter the question mark where you can\\nchange it because this is what is known\\nas queries\\neven if you go to Google after the\\nquestion mark you'll see the cool stuff\\nthe stuff you can change so we have\\nquestion mark Q as equal to London so\\nthis is basically this place name you\\nwant to get the weather off so we can\\ntake this out and put it in a variable\\nof our own let's call this London over\\nhere\\nlet's take the city name and put Dollar\\nCity name like this\\nthen we have comma UK it's just telling\\nLondon comma UK this is where I want to\\nget the weather off then we have app ID\\nand this is our app ID Now app IDs need\\nto be stored in dot EnV file which can\\nbe hidden by\\nget ignore and even when you want to\\ndeploy your website but assuming you're\\nnot going to deploy this website let's\\nput it in a separate file of its own\\nwhich you can ignore if you're pushing\\nto GitHub now if you don't know what\\nGitHub means don't worry about it just\\nsave it in a different file let's go\\nahead and call this\\nsecrets.\\nand here I'm going to have constant\\nopen whether\\nAPI key which is equal to this time\\nnow we'll copy this come over here and\\nhave Dollar open Weather API key also\\npress command full stop to import the\\nparticular secrets.file\\nlet's see if this much and let's see\\nwhat we get let's put a weight here we\\nalready know the protocol let's have\\nfinal result is equal to this then we\\nare going to have print result dot body\\nbecause I just want to see what all it\\ngives me\\nand now if I restart I see absolutely\\nnothing why because this function is not\\ncalled\\nwe need to call it somewhere right we\\ncan go ahead and call this in build\\nfunction but I already told you before\\nthat build function needs to be\\nkept away from asynchronous stuff\\nand I've also mentioned the reason\\nbefore\\nbuild function should always be the\\nleast expensive so you can you should\\nnot call this function in the build\\nfunction so what should we do\\nwell we can do one thing we can convert\\nthe stateless widget to a stateful\\nwidget then use the init State method\\nand then we can call this particular\\nfunction over there right that sounds\\nreasonable\\nso to create a stateful widget we'll\\nhave to do stf L and create a stateful\\nwidget right not really\\nthe dart and flutter extension is quite\\ngenerous with this you can just press\\nCtrl shift r\\nyou get the options to change stuff and\\nyou have convert to stateful widget if\\nyou just click on it it will make the\\nappropriate changes and convert it to a\\nstateful widget without giving any error\\nso our stateless widget is Now stateful\\nwidget with just one click and our\\nmethod is also defined over here\\ncorrectly not inside of the stateful\\nwidget\\nclass it's correctly defined inside of\\nthis class\\nnow let's go ahead and create nth state\\nthe super.net state should always be at\\nthe top\\nthen we have get current weather\\nsave it command J\\nand you see as soon as we reload it\\ngives us an error if we restart it will\\nagain give us an error the reason for\\nthis is\\n401 error 401 error stands for bad\\nrequest\\nas you already know 404 stands for\\npage not found so four zero four is\\nso four zero one is there so that\\nyou see that it's a bad request and a\\nmessage is also provided for further\\ncontext saying invalid API key please\\nsee this thing for more info\\nnow if I click over here open it\\nyou see API calls return on error 401\\nand these are the possible things that's\\nwhy it gave us an error you did not\\nspecify your API key we did your API key\\nis not activated yet next couple of\\nhours it will be activated and ready to\\nuse so this is a problem\\nrest of the things are fine we are using\\nthe free subscription we are not using\\nthe wrong API key and only we have not\\nwaited for the uh for a couple of hours\\nso I'll see you after a couple of hours\\nwhen our API key is activated and we can\\nuse it so I'm back after three hours and\\nthe data is now coming we have all the\\ndata we require to display it on the\\nscreen so now let's just understand what\\nis useful for us and what is not so that\\nwe can only include parts that are\\nuseful to us and extract them right so\\nthe first thing that we require is well\\nI just want to take this and put it in\\nsome form of\\nvisualizer where I can properly see the\\ndata so what I'm going to do is copy\\nthis URL go to Google Chrome paste it\\nand obviously we need to pass in some\\nstuff like the city name should be\\nLondon the app ID should be present so\\nlet's go ahead and pass in the app ID\\nwhich is present in secrets\\nand when I press enter I see all the\\nstuff that I require right\\nnow if you see this data this data is\\ngiving me\\nthe weather\\nthe main temperature so I'm getting what\\nthe temperature right now in London is\\nand I'm getting wind speed and all of\\nthat stuff but I'm not getting the\\nforecast and that's because we have used\\nthe wrong API\\nthe API we should be using is not data\\n2.5 weather because this will give us\\nthe weather I want forecast so I'll just\\ngo ahead and pass in forecast here and\\nI'll be able to get the forecast of\\nthe weather you see this list has 40\\nitems and if you're wondering how I'm\\nhaving this Json in\\nthis format it's because of an extension\\nand the extension name is Json formatto\\nall right now you see we have a list\\nthat returns 40 items and in every list\\nwe have an object and in this object or\\na map we are getting the temperature\\nthen we are getting the\\nweather name that we require in our app\\nover here\\nthen we have the pressure humidity\\nall of that stuff right so we need to\\nuse the forecast wire and\\nusing this we can extract the data\\nso what is the data we require well\\nfirst of all\\nI want to check if it's a status code of\\n200 or not the status code of 200\\nbasically says that hey this request is\\nsuccessful\\notherwise we get a status code of 401\\nwhich was like bad request so yeah first\\nof all I want to make sure that it's a\\ncorrect request\\nalso I want to try it in a\\nwrap it in a try and catch block so\\nlet's go ahead have try catch block\\nthen we have through e.2 string I've not\\ntalked about throw in the dot section\\nbecause I wanted to specifically show it\\nover here what through does is basically\\nlike if you want to return something\\nfrom a function\\nand suddenly you encounter an error so\\nyou just throw that error you're saying\\nthat this function when it was called\\ndid not give any result it resulted in\\nan error\\nand that means your app will crash if it\\nis not handled\\nso I'm just throwing the error that hey\\nI received an error just take it and\\ndisplay it on the screen or do whatever\\nyou want so we need to correctly handle\\nthis throw all right\\notherwise\\nour app will break\\nthe next thing I want to do here is\\nfirst of all check the status code if\\nit's 200 or not so for this I can do\\nif response dot status code is equal\\nequal to 200 this is one way of doing it\\nthe other way of doing it is taking the\\nstatus code that they've mentioned over\\nhere\\nso first of all we'll have to decode the\\nresponse dot body because it is in a\\nstring format we already saw that in the\\ndot section so we have json.json decode\\nput it in rest dot body save it\\nand also you see as soon as I import\\nJson decode dot convert gets imported\\nnow\\nyou can see Json decode required a\\nstring source so we have passed and\\nresponse to our body it returns a\\ndynamic so what I want to do is final\\ndata is equal to Json decode\\nand after I have the data with me\\nI can just check if\\ndata at COD that's what it's called\\nright Cod\\nis not equal to 200 and I'm putting it\\nin strings over here because Cod returns\\nto as a string\\nright\\nthe alternative to this could be\\nconverting this to an integer\\nso you could go ahead and do n dot parse\\nwhat we have learned before\\nto convert from string to an integer and\\nthen you can check is not equal to 200\\nlike this both of these things work you\\ncan use whatever B you prefer and that\\nwill work fine all right\\nso let's go ahead with this part right\\nhere\\nso if the status code is not 200 that\\nmeans some error occurred if some error\\noccurred then we again want to throw\\nsaying an unexpected error occurred\\nI hope you're understanding what throw\\nmeans I mean of course you won't\\nunderstand it right now but when we call\\nthe function\\nit will basically throw you an exception\\nsaying that hey there is an unhandled\\nexception\\nsaying that an unexpected error occurred\\nall right and in the else condition or\\nyou can just have it over here no need\\nof health condition because through\\nbasically returns from the function it\\ndoesn't execute any further just like\\nreturn does all right\\nso if you put through here\\nit will terminate the function at this\\npoint it won't go any further\\nand finally what I'm going to do is\\nprint data\\nat and the thing I want to print is the\\ntemperature wire so we are going to have\\ndata which gives us this thing\\ndata at least so with list I'll access\\nthis thing so I'll have data at list and\\nsince it's a list I will access the\\nzeroth element on it to get the first\\nprediction or the First Data stuff\\nso here I have it\\nand I'll do listed 0 then I'm going to\\nhave Main\\nand after that I'm going to have\\ntemperature\\nokay\\nso list at 0 which is the first map then\\nwe have Main and then we are accessing\\nthe temperature so that should give us\\nlet's say 291.8 or something similar\\nlet's go over here let's restart the app\\nand we do 3290 1.65 so we were\\nsuccessful in retrieving the correct\\nstuffs now we just want to display it on\\nthe screen right I want to display it\\nover here how can I display this thing\\nover here it's enclosed in a function\\nright so what I can do is create a\\nglobal variable let's call this\\ndouble temperature\\nwhich is equal to let's say 0 initially\\nor you might be tempted to use late\\ndouble because we are assigning the\\nvalue late right so this should work\\nbut let's see if it actually works I'm\\ngoing to set temperature equal to this\\nokay and now I'm going to pass\\ntemperature over here so I'm going to\\nhave dollar temperature k\\nso it gives me 291.12 Kelvin now I'm\\nalso going to remove constant let's put\\nthe correct constants everywhere\\nagain I'm pressing option to select\\nmultiple cursors and put constant cool\\nlet's come back over here and you see\\nlate initialization error field temp has\\nnot been initialized let's restart it\\nmaybe that works not really this doesn't\\nwork why because\\nif we come over here we get current\\nweather\\nthis thing runs before the build\\nfunction\\nand that's cool\\nbut what if I do print\\nbuild function or let's call this init\\nstate\\nthen I'm going to print this statement\\nagain over here\\nfunction called\\nthen I'm going to print after this API\\ncall all right after this API call I'm\\ngoing to I have API ended all right\\nand finally I'm going to have a print\\nstatement saying build\\nfunction called\\nnow let's open\\nby using command J restart and you see\\nover here init state\\nwe have in its data where\\nthen we have function called and then we\\ndirectly have build function called\\nso it skipped this part\\nbut earlier we printed this value and it\\ngot printed correctly right then why is\\nit giving an error right now well that's\\nbecause\\nwhat you're doing is assigning this to\\nlate late basically means that\\nyou have a contract you need to assign\\nit before the build function is called\\nif you're using it obviously in the\\nbuild function if you're not using it in\\nthe build function\\nlate doesn't really care\\nbut if you're using it somewhere\\nit will start to care\\nso what happens is late double\\ntemperature then you are having in its\\nstate then you have get current weather\\nthis function gets called and this API\\ncall is there now this API call is going\\nto take time right you're retrieving\\nsome data from the web that will take\\ntime depending on your internet\\nconnection\\nbut while it is waiting we have already\\nexecuted the build function because\\nthat's how asynchronous stuff works\\nit won't wait for it to complete it just\\nsaid hey just complete this in the\\nfuture\\nI'll just go ahead and do my stuff so it\\ncalled the build function and here when\\nthe build function was called you also\\ncalled The Late variable temperature\\nwhich hasn't been initialized\\nthat's the problem\\nso what should we do then\\nwhat is the fixed aware well first of\\nall let's just remove all the print\\ncalls\\nI don't like seeing warnings that much\\nunless there are constant warnings\\nso we are back to normal now so one\\npossible fix here is having double\\ntemperature is equal to zero as soon as\\nwe do that press command J\\nrestart the app come over here we get\\n0.0 Kelvin again the value is not\\ninitialized what is the other case\\nwell that's the case because\\nyou again\\nset this to zero then you have get\\ncurrent weather it is getting the data\\nin the background let's say\\nand in the meantime it also called the\\nbuild function if it called the build\\nfunction it already used the value of\\ntemperature given to it which was zero\\nand later on when the value arrived\\nthe build function was already ready and\\ndisplaying it but then you said hey set\\ntemperature equal to this thing over\\nhere so you're reassigning the value\\nafter the build function is called it's\\nas good as calling a function after\\nontap\\nso my point is you just need to wrap it\\nwith a set state\\nif you do such State what will happen is\\nwhen you restart\\nyou see 0 and then it converts to 291.65\\nbecause initially the value is 0 then\\nit's retrieving the value in the\\nmeantime you'll show the value of 0\\nover here and then you finally got the\\nvalue of temperature\\nwhich you have assigned and then you\\ncall such state to rebuild the build\\nfunction and that way\\nyou get\\n291.65 Kelvin\\nso I hope that made sense to you if it\\ndid not ask me in the comment section\\nand I'll explain it to you again but\\nanyways if we again restart the app this\\ndoes not look good it's not a good user\\nexperience to show zero Kelvin first\\nthen show\\n291.65 Kelvin\\nit's just not a good experience so what\\nI want to show instead is a loading\\nindicator so as\\nlong as this function is loading and we\\nare getting a data we are just going to\\nkeep loading the screen\\nso I'm just going to replace this body\\npart with a circular progress indicator\\ninstead as long as as it's loading all\\nright so this all will disappear and\\nonly a loading indicator will show up\\nso let's go ahead and have a body here\\nnow how do I show a loading indicator\\nhere well the first approach is to use\\nthe temperature and have if temperature\\nis equal to zero\\nthen we can use\\na loading indicator now what is the\\nwidget for loading indicator well it's\\njust\\nprogress indicator and you can have two\\ntypes of progress indicator or three\\ntypes\\nI don't know but you can have leaner\\nprogress indicator refresh progress\\nindicator circular progress indicator\\nthe one I like the most is circular\\nprogress indicator however go ahead and\\ntry linear progress indicator and\\nrefresh progress indicator for yourself\\nI'm going to go ahead with circular\\nprogress indicator now I'm also going to\\nhave Constable air the reason I'm doing\\ntemperature is equal equal to 0\\nis because the temperature can never be\\nzero Kelvin\\nif it's zero Kelvin then we are freezing\\nit's absolute temperature right that's\\nwhy if it was some other value I\\nwouldn't put is equal equal to 0 because\\nsome other temperature can be attained\\nlet's say the initial value was\\n270. I wouldn't do\\ntemperature is equal equal to 270\\nbecause temperature can be 270 Kelvin\\nbut because temperature can be 270\\nKelvin when it is coming from this thing\\nright here\\nsome place might have a temperature of\\n270 Kelvin but no place has a\\ntemperature of\\nzero Kelvin that's why I'm using it to\\ndisplay a circular progress indicator\\nhowever another option could be to use\\nanother variable called Boolean is\\nloading which is initially set to false\\nthen you come away you set State you set\\nis loading to true so you're basically\\ntelling hey rebuild the build function\\nis loading is now true\\nthen here you have\\nis loading\\nset to false\\nand you come down and you just have\\nis loading\\nif it's loading then show circular\\nprogress indicator otherwise the padding\\nis fine now let's restart\\nand you see we see a circular progress\\nindicator in the left hand side and then\\nthis thing\\nso that means our loading indicator is\\nworking however if you use temperature\\nis equal equal to 0 as well it will work\\njust fine\\nlet's restart\\nyou see 270 Kelvin not 270 Kelvin sorry\\nI'll set it to 0\\nI'll restart loading indicator is there\\nand then I see this thing over here\\nso I hope that made sense to you\\nnow you can use either of those\\napproaches it is on you but my point\\nright now is this is quite tedious to be\\nhonest I have to set up my own loading\\nindicators I have to set up my own error\\nhandlers for example if I just misspell\\nin something in the API and then I start\\nto run my function I'll see an error all\\nright you see unhandle exception format\\nexception blah blah blah blah\\nand it continuously keeps loading\\nbecause I haven't set up my it's loading\\nproperly in case of an error I have to\\nset it to false even here\\nif there's an error I have to set as\\nloading set to false so I have to do all\\nof this stuff on my own and it's quite\\ntedious for me\\nluckily flutter has something for us\\nlet's look at it\\nalso\\nyou see unhandled exception format\\nexception all of that\\nand if we use let's say data 3 over here\\nand then restart\\nyou'll see unhandled exception and\\nunexpected error occurred what we had\\nover here\\nso basically throw is just returning an\\nexception for you\\nand the error message can be whatever\\nyou have written over here so I hope\\nthat made sense to you what this throw\\ndoes it basically throws an exception\\nand whenever you have an unhandled\\nexception you have to add a try and a\\ncatch block here and do stuff on your\\nown however\\nyou have to put a try on catch block\\nhere let's have e over here and then you\\nhave get current weather\\nthen whatever error it gives you just\\nprint e all of that stuff you'll have to\\ndo it or just don't throw from here\\nhowever my point is there's a lot of\\nstuff to do a lot of error handling to\\ndo instead\\nI can use something provided by flutter\\nwhich will\\nboost my performance by a lot so let's\\nremove energy State let's remove this\\nloading let's remove the temperature as\\nwell\\nall the set states are not required\\nanymore\\nwe can keep this line over here because\\nwe are going to extract the mean\\ntemperature again but not over here\\nand what we are going to do is just\\nreturn data in case of a status code of\\n200. now let's come over here let's\\nremove the loading indicator for now\\nand here again we're going to go back to\\nthe static value however you already\\nknow\\nconstants are not going to be needed\\nanymore because we are all going to have\\na dynamic value so let's not use\\nconstant because the value is going to\\nkeep changing it's coming from an API\\nall right and what I'm going to do is\\nwrap padding widget with\\nanother widget and what is that widget\\nfuture\\nBuilder this is a widget provided by\\nflutter that\\neases our life by a lot when dealing\\nwith Futures and if we want to display\\nsomething related to our future\\nso we're going to have a future we are\\ngoing to have a builder\\nthen we are going to have context\\nsnapshot I'll explain what snapshot is\\nand we're going to have an RO function\\nreturned from a builder so these are two\\nrequired arguments of future Builder\\nquite convenient future and Builder now\\nI'll explain both of these things but\\nlet's resolve the error we have only\\nfuture so what is this future build up\\nwell basically you just need to pass in\\nyour future over here it can be anything\\nfuture of object and object is a super\\nclass of everything\\nso you can pass any function over here\\nany variable that is a future\\nand it will build according to it so if\\nI go ahead and return my function which\\nis a future\\nso I'm going to have get current weather\\nand then let's just convert this to a\\nblock all right I don't want an arrow\\nfunction because I want to print\\nsomething here\\nI cannot print\\nfunction does not allow it it just\\nallows me to return one thing if I just\\nconvert it to a block I'll be able to\\nprint it so press Ctrl shift R get the\\nrefactoring option and it asks you to\\nconvert to block body\\nso let's convert it\\nsave it it will format let's go right\\nover here and we are going to print\\nsnapshot what exactly is this snapshot\\nalso we're going to print the runtime\\ntype of the snapshot\\nso press command J\\nwe're going to restart\\nand we see something like async snapshot\\nDynamic connection state DOT weighting\\nasync snapshot Dynamic so this is the\\nruntime type then we have our entire\\nvalue coming and A6 snapshot dynamic\\nso what is this thing over here well\\nsnapshot is basically a class that\\nallows you to\\nhandle States in your app a loading\\nstate\\na data State an error State you can\\nhandle all of that using async snapshot\\nthat's what snapshot gives us\\nyou see over your connection state DOT\\nwaiting why did this connection state\\nDOT weight income because you were\\ngetting data from the web so it's saying\\nthat hey we are still getting your data\\nthen we have the runtime type because we\\nprinted it and after a while it said\\nconnection state DOT done that hey we\\ngot your data it's successfully there\\nand\\nit printed it out to us this null null\\nnull stands for each and everything if\\nit's if it is having data if it is\\nhaving error if it is having loading\\nwhat is it having\\nso that's what null null stands for over\\nhere\\nso anyways now that we understand this\\nwe can handle the loading State easily\\nwe know whenever there's loading State\\nwe have connection State DOT waiting so\\nif we have if snapshot Dot\\nnow what do we use snapshot dot hash\\ndata has error connection state\\nright because this might be an enum or a\\nclass I don't know\\nand this requires a connection State as\\nwell so I'm just going to have if\\nsnapshots dot connection state is equal\\nto connection State DOT and it is an\\nenum and it gives us values like active\\ndone none waiting\\nwhen it's loading it is giving us\\nwaiting right so we can just use that\\nand return\\na circular progress indicator Also let's\\nreturn a constant over here perfect now\\nif I restart I see the loading indicator\\nand 200 Kelvin I again restart I see\\nloading indicator 200 Kelvin\\nnow 200 Kelvin is not the correct value\\nit's hard coded but you see we are\\ngetting the loading indicator and then\\nour data so we don't have to handle all\\nof the stuff on our own if there's error\\nwe can print it how we can just have if\\nsnapshot dot has error\\nif snapshot has error then we are going\\nto return constant text saying snapshot\\ndot Arrow which is an object all right\\nand this can't be a constant because\\nsnapshot dot error\\nis a dynamic value it's coming from\\nsnapshot right it's not a static value\\nit's not a hard-coded value or a\\nconstant value so we need to return\\ntext Dot to string because text cannot\\ntake an object it has to take in a\\nstring\\nso we return an error\\nall right\\nso if snapshot has zero that means if\\nthe async snapshot has error then we\\njust want a text to show the error on\\nthe screen\\nand what return will do is basically\\njust return this text from here it will\\nnot display anything from here and\\nthat's exactly what we want in case of\\nerror just display it to the user don't\\ndisplay wrong values that's not how our\\napp works let's get rid of snapshot\\nlet's save this restart we have a\\nloading indicator and there's no error\\nso it doesn't show anything however if I\\njust take this\\nnot take this if I spell this\\nincorrectly let's say\\ndata 3\\nlet's restart the app you see loading\\nindicator and then an unexpected error\\noccurred that's a good sign\\nnow if you want to return a different\\nkind of message you can do that you can\\nhave data\\nmessage because with every code which is\\nnot 200 we get a message as well when we\\nhad four zero one we had a message as\\nwell you see internal error shows up now\\nthat's what the error says\\nif here I type in data at\\nthree forecast it says internal error\\nand the code is 404 are favored not\\nfound\\nso let's come back to our 2.5 model even\\nhere 2.5 model\\nI think I'm going to keep an unexpected\\nerror occurred that's a better message\\nthan whatever the API might give us\\ncool so now we are able to handle the\\nloading indicator and the error message\\nnow let's style it a little bit because\\nthe loading indicator is showing right\\nin the left hand side corner so let's\\nCenter it to center it Ctrl shift r\\nthen wrap it with Center you all are\\nexperts in this now you can just pass in\\nconstant\\nand now a loading indicator will be\\ncentered perfect\\nI still have some problem with it\\nif I restart it's showing a material\\ndesign\\nloading indicator on an iOS simulator\\nwhat I want to do is show this kind of\\nicon\\nor this kind of loading indicator only\\non Android devices not on iOS devices\\nthat's why what I'm going to do is use\\ncircular progress indicator dot adaptive\\nwith adaptive\\nit changes based on\\nthe operating system it's on so if it's\\non iOS it gives a iOS kind of indicator\\nand if we open a pixel it will give us\\nthe material design\\nprogress indicator and that's really\\ncool it just gives us a native feel\\nnow if you want to use circular progress\\nindicator you can use it I just wanted\\nto show this cool thing to you\\nalso this text can be centered so let's\\ngo ahead and wrap it with Center sweet\\nnow\\nwe have handled the loading State we\\nhave handled the error State and finally\\nwe are on the data state so let's go\\nahead and retrieve our data for our\\nfirst data we have already implemented\\nthe logic for it so let's just copy that\\nso here we're going to have final data\\nwhich is equal to\\nsnapshot.data and this data can be\\nnullable all right\\nso we are just going to apply here that\\nhey the data here is never going to be\\nnullable also\\nI've already mentioned this to you\\nbefore whenever we return future or\\nanything like stream future always make\\nsure that you have a generic type\\nbecause future Dynamic isn't cool we've\\ndiscussed this in dot course\\nso what I want to do is return a future\\nof some type and here I'm going to\\nreturn data but what is the data well it\\nis a map because at the end of the day\\nwe are getting an object of string\\nso everything over here is a string in\\nthe left hand side all the keys are\\nstrings\\nbut on the right hand side sometimes it\\nis integer sometimes it is string\\nso we can just have future of map of\\nstring comma dynamic\\nso here the dynamic is necessary because\\nstuff keeps changing on the value side\\non the right hand side\\ncool now if you come over here\\nyou see\\nsnapshot.data has a value of map string\\ncomma Dynamic with a nullable option\\nfirst of all future Builder is correctly\\nable to identify based on the future we\\nprovided over here\\nand secondly this is nullable why is\\nthis nullable because it thinks that it\\nmight not have an error why does this\\nhave a nullable option because it thinks\\nthat maybe there's an error maybe\\nthere's loading state it cannot\\ndefinitely have a value that's why it is\\nnullable but now since we have handled\\nthe error State and we have handled the\\nloading state\\nwe are quite sure that it is going to\\nhave a value\\notherwise you can just check it on your\\nown if snapshot dot has data what has\\ndata does behind the scenes is just\\ncheck if data is not null it's basically\\nchecking if data is not equal to null\\nthat is what snapshot.house data is and\\nsame goes for has error error is not\\nequal to null\\nokay\\nyou can do that but here I'm quite\\nconfident it is going to have data now\\nI'm going to have final current\\nweather\\ntemperature\\nor let's just say current temperature\\nbecause we are also having forecast\\nright if there's forecast there's a\\npossibility of having\\nlater values as well so that won't be\\ncurrent temperature\\nso we're going to final current\\ntemperature and we're going to set it to\\ndata list 0 main temperature which was\\nour main temperature or the current\\ntemperature that we want to show\\nand finally we are going to come back\\nhere and type dollar current temperature\\nKelvin restart\\nand with the loading indicator we get\\nthe right value perfect so the first\\npart of our app is complete congrats to\\nus\\nnow let's go ahead and change this icon\\nand this text based on what we get so\\nthis icon over here is based on the text\\nright if it's sunny I want to show a sun\\nif it's rain cloud whatever I want to\\nshow\\na cloud icon\\nand for that we have a value in our list\\nwhich is weather mean\\nso what I need to do is\\nfinal current\\nwhat do we call this\\ncurrent Sky because it is telling me how\\nthe sky is cloudy whatever\\nso let's call this current sky\\nand then we are going to have data at\\nlist at 0\\nsame thing as before data list 0\\nthen we're going to have weather instead\\nof Main\\nand then we are going to have the main\\ncool now we can take this current sky\\nand paste it over here\\nso you're going to have\\ncurrent sky like this and it's going to\\nbe a string all right\\nbecause main clouds\\nthis is a string\\nso save it put it as constant come back\\nover here\\nand it gives us an error why because the\\ntype string is not a subtype of type int\\nof index let's see why we get this error\\nand the reason for this error\\nis if you come over here weather is a\\nlist we neglected that\\nwe directly said hey data listed 0\\nwhether\\nis a list and what we are saying is\\ncalled\\nthe main property on a list the list\\ncannot have a main property\\nonly maps have that only objects have\\nthat so first we need to access this\\nparticular array and after that we can\\naccess main property on it so here we\\nneed to do whether at zero so we iterate\\nor we grab the first element of the list\\nand then we call the main method on it\\nor the main property on it and when you\\ncome over here clouds are seen\\nperfect\\nnow you see we are repeating stuff over\\nhere data at less zero so what I can do\\nis shift this in another variable so I\\ncan have final current weather data\\nis equal to data listed 0\\nbecause technically this current\\nthis consists of current weather data\\nand now I can replace it with this\\nnow this is just an improvement so that\\nyou know you have better readability in\\nyour functions or in your classes or in\\nyour UI code\\nand you don't have to repeat this stuff\\nagain and again data list 0.\\nyou just store it in a variable and you\\ncan use it anywhere now I'm going to\\ntake this current Sky I'm going to\\ngo down remove constant from icon and\\nhere I'm going to have if current sky is\\nequal to either cloud\\nor current sky is equal equal to drain\\nthose are two possibilities all right\\nand you can put or condition in\\na ternary operator\\nso if it's either of them then we want\\nto display icons dot Cloud otherwise\\nicons dot sunny\\nnow if we come back over here we are\\nseeing\\na sun and that's because\\nthe data we are getting is clouds not\\nCloud so we need to make sure this is\\nthe correct thing and you know make sure\\nthe case sensitivity is also correct\\nclouds is not equal to\\nCapital C clouds all right so make sure\\neverything is correct you come back over\\nhere and you see clouds perfect so this\\npart over here is done now let's move to\\nadditional information and after that we\\ncan get to the weather forecast\\nso in additional information we have\\nhumidity and I've spelled that wrong\\neven after trying to correct it\\nlet's go ahead and type it over here\\nnow let's get let's get the values of\\nhumidity when speed and pressure let's\\nexplore the API to see if the it has\\nvalues and I'm just going to grab this\\nfirst\\ncurrent weather because that should give\\nme\\nthe wind speed the pressure all of that\\nstuff I should not be going to the\\nsecond element of this list because that\\ncontains the prediction for later on\\nit's not the prediction as of right now\\nyou see\\nit has a prediction of some other time\\nthis is the current prediction\\nso to access pressure we have this thing\\nover here which is present in main we've\\nalready done this before so let's go\\nright at the top\\nwe are going to have final\\ncurrent pressure\\nyou want to type current you can type it\\nor pressure because you have only one\\npressure in our entire app which is the\\ncurrent pressure\\nand set that equal to well the current\\nweather data so you can have\\ncurrent weather data\\nso you're act already over here then you\\nhave to access main pressure\\nso you have Main\\npressure\\ncool now take this mean pressure go down\\nin additional info item you see this\\nthing over here\\nthis is this is where you can easily go\\nfrom top to the bottom you don't have to\\nscroll through stuff you can directly\\njust jump from year to year\\nand it just saves a lot of time for me\\nso get used to this and it will save you\\na bunch of time\\nespecially in bigger code bases\\nso we are over here now\\nthe value is going to be 91 but in our\\ncase\\nnot 91 sorry it's not humidity it's\\npressure\\nin our case we need to mention a string\\nbut here it's giving us a number\\nall right\\nall the numbers are marked in blue\\nstrings are marked and green\\nso it's giving us a number so maybe we\\ncan have current pressure dot two string\\nwith two string we are able to only get\\nthe required pressure Also let's remove\\nconstant from here we all know it's not\\ngoing to be a constant\\nlet's save it come back over here and\\nthe pressure is one zero one one perfect\\nthe next thing we require is wind speed\\nhow do I get wind speed well it's\\npresent over here in wind speed\\nso same thing we'll go over here\\nand Define a variable now obviously you\\ncan copy this and\\ngo down paste it over here and that will\\nwork fine for you there's no problem\\nwith it but when you have variables in\\none centralized place in my opinion it\\njust gets so much easier because if you\\nwant to change anything you can change\\nall the API related stuff in one place\\nso let's come back to current wind speed\\nand that is going to be wind\\nspeed because we are aware data at least\\nis 0 this thing over here then we are\\ngoing to wind then speed and we're\\ngetting the value\\nwe can copy this go down\\nthen I have current wind speed dot two\\nstring again\\nsave it come over here we have 4.45 as\\nour speed perfect\\nand the last thing we require is\\nhumidity and humidity is also present in\\nthe same place as our pressure\\nso let's go to current pressure now if\\nyou press command on our current\\npressure variable you'll be able to go\\nwhere the current pressure variable is\\ndefined just like we can do with\\nliterally anything right if you want to\\ngo to sized box you can click it over\\nhere and we go to the flutter source\\ncode\\nif you want to do that in your own\\nsource code you can do that as well so\\nyou go to current pressure now I'm going\\nto copy this paste it again\\nand now I'm going to have current\\nhumidity now I know I'm going a bit\\nfaster here and I'm doing that because\\nthis is all the stuff we have covered in\\nthe dot course just knowing what to use\\nwhen to use I want to waste much time\\nover here right so yeah main humidity\\nwe'll take this current humidity and\\npaste it over here and again pass two\\nstring to it because it's a number\\ncome back over here and our humidity 48\\nis showing all good\\nthe last thing we want to do is weather\\nforecast and that too for only five\\nitems you see in our API it gives us a\\nlist of 40 items the first one we've\\nalready used so we are not going to use\\nit again our numbering is now going to\\nstart from 1.\\nbecause 0 was used to display the\\ncurrent weather now everything from here\\nis going to display the weather forecast\\nso let's go to our\\nweather forecast over here early\\nforecast item let's call this early\\nforecast instead of weather forecast all\\nright that that makes more sense I guess\\nnow how do we handle this\\nI want to iterate through a list\\nwhich is a list\\nget five elements\\nand display them on the screen\\nthat's a major after task to do here\\ndo you know how you'll do it\\ntry to do it on your own if you can and\\nyou'll be more confident if you do it\\nbut if you're not then I'll let you know\\nyou can think about using a for Loop all\\nright when you use a for Loop\\nlet's remove a constant\\nwhenever you use a for Loop\\nyou can go from index one to index five\\nand display it on the screen\\nso let's try it what I'm going to do is\\nfor\\nint I is equal to 1 because I want my\\nlist to start from one I cannot start\\nfrom 0 or I can start from zero entire\\nis equal to 0 I is less than\\n5 because I only want five elements I\\nplus plus\\nthen I'm going to have my Ali forecast\\nitem\\nI'm going to remove the rest of the\\nearly forecast items\\nand first of all we require a Time now\\nwhere is the time mentioned in our list\\nit's mentioned over here DT underscore\\ntxt in this format\\nwe'll get to the date format part later\\non we only want to get time but it's\\ngiving us date and time both but we'll\\nget to it later on as of now let's just\\ndisplay\\nthe entire thing even if we get\\nthe render flow error the error that\\nshows up in the yellow saying that the\\nheight is extended like we saw over here\\nwith our row when we are not wrapped it\\nwith single child scroll view remember\\nthat\\nif we remove this widget\\nyou see this error this is render flow\\nerror and we will get that if\\nwe exceed the size already allotted to a\\nparticular widget\\nso anyways\\num\\nlet's get access to the list so it's\\ngoing to be data at list\\nso it's going to be data at least at I\\nnot zero not one not anything but if we\\nput I we get I is equal to 0 so that\\nmeans data at least it's 0 that means\\nyou are getting the same value\\ninstead I'm going to do data at least at\\nI plus 1 with I plus 1 I get the\\nstarting value as 1 till\\n5 including 5 all right so we'll get the\\ncorrect stuff\\nso we'll get elements from 1\\nor elements one two three four five\\nthat sounds good and once we are over\\nhere let's say we are aware perfect so\\nfirst of all I'm just going to print the\\ndate time or the date and you can do two\\nthings for it DT which gives you date\\nand let's say I think milliseconds since\\nEpoch now what is Epoch Epoch is January\\n1 1970\\nso how many milliseconds have passed\\nsince January 1 1970 this is what the\\ndaytime is\\nand in text\\nthis is what it represents third July\\n2023 12 am\\nso you can use either of them I'm going\\nto go ahead and use DT for now later on\\nI'm going to use DT text\\nso that I can format it according to the\\nway I want and if I come over here we\\nget type int is not a type of string\\nbecause time requires string so let's\\nconvert it to a string and then pass it\\nin and we have this thing over here and\\nit keeps changing for everything\\nwe have one six eight eight three four\\nto four hundred one six eight eight\\nthree five three two hundred all right\\nso I hope you get the point\\nthen we can have the same thing over\\nhere\\ndata at least I plus 1\\nmain temperature so we're going to have\\nMain\\ntemp\\ncome over here and it says type double\\nis not a subtype of type string\\nbasically temperature is giving us a\\ndouble value temperature requires year a\\nstring value so call to string again\\ncome back and you see 289.84\\n287.855 and all of that stuff looks good\\nand finally we want to display the\\ncorrect icon now to display the current\\nicon we have already put a logic\\nand we know how\\nto evaluate if it's\\na good thing or not\\nso what we need to do is\\ngo at the top have current Sky scroll\\nback\\nand we're just going to have if current\\nbe the weather data instead of current\\nweather data I'm going to have data at\\nleast at I plus 1 right because current\\nweather data is data at least at zero\\ninstead of having zero here I'm having I\\nplus one I hope you're following along\\nso you have data at least I plus 1\\nthen main then temperature main\\ntemperature\\nnot mean temperature sorry\\nI plus 1 whether\\n0 mean and if that is equal to clouds or\\nif that exact thing is equal to\\nrain then we are going to have icons dot\\nCloud otherwise I can start Sunny then\\nwe save it\\nbecome aware and you see when we add\\na sunny weather we had\\nSunny icon showing up\\nnow if we come back over here just to\\nverify we are going to go over here\\nwe'll see\\nthat the main over here is clear and in\\nclear we want to show Cloud no sun we\\ndon't want to show clouds clouds is only\\nthere for rain and stuff\\nokay so yeah we have been able to build\\nthe app\\nthe problem here is what if\\ninstead of showing five things I want to\\nshow 40 things\\nexactly how much\\nthis allows\\nor 39 because\\nor let's say 38\\nand let's say I want to return or have\\nless than 39 items here\\nthen what will happen well if I restart\\nyou see we get a bunch of our icons\\nthose are all good\\nbut what's Happening Here is they are\\nnot building on demand they are all\\nbuilding together now we are getting our\\nweather forecast and that all is correct\\nthat's all good that's perfect but the\\nproblem here isn't about displaying and\\ngetting the correct data it's about a\\nperformance of the app all the widgets\\nhere are building together that's a big\\nproblem when we are returning like 40\\nwidgets together right because it's like\\n40 widgets are building together isn't\\nthat just insane\\nit will affect the performance of the\\napp very much\\nso instead of building 40 widgets\\ntogether at the same time what I want to\\ndo is build this widget\\njust when we scroll all right\\nso it lazily creates our widgets only\\nthe part that is scrolled will get\\ncreated otherwise it won't get created\\nso it won't affect the performance of\\nour app\\nI hope you understood this if not I'll\\nrepeat you can skip if you understood\\nwhat I'm saying is 40 widgets are being\\ncreated together now that is a Major\\nPerformance thing because just imagine\\nlike 40 components on the screen\\ntogether at the same time that's just\\nmaking sure that your app performs less\\nwell\\nso what I want to do is Implement kind\\nof like lazy loading where the widgets\\nare being lazily loaded\\nnot the data we get the data as it is\\nbut the widgets are being created on\\ndemand as and when I scroll all right so\\nlike if I scroll like this the widget\\nshould get created not all at once\\nso\\nfor this I'm just going to go ahead and\\ncomment out the entire single child\\nscroll View\\nand I'm going to create my own early\\nforecast from scratch using a widget\\nwhich is very very important\\nand that is called list view Builder\\nsee this thing over here list view\\nBuilder there's another widget called\\nlist view which we haven't talked about\\nand list view is basically like you know\\nif you want a column that is scrollable\\nand you want to\\nmention padding from the side you can go\\nahead and list use list View\\nit will help you over there\\nwe are probably going to use list View\\nlater on in a third app\\nbut\\nas of right now we're going to use list\\nview dot Builder\\nit requires a named argument of item\\nBuilder and it gives us context and\\nindex\\nalso one thing I think I forgot to\\nmention is whenever you have for Loop if\\nconditions inside of flutter code you\\ndon't have to mention brackets\\nI'm so sorry I forgot to mention this\\nbrackets are not required when you have\\nflutter code\\nyou can just mention for Loop no need of\\nbracket and if you want to return more\\nthan just\\nOne widget you can have dot dot dot and\\na list\\nokay\\nso what you're basically doing is\\nwrapping all of them in a list\\nand then you're destructuring the list\\nso that everything shows up\\nfor all the 40 Widgets or 39 widgets all\\nright\\nso let's remove it we only want to\\nhave one widget for Loop\\nthat's why I'm just going to keep it\\nlike this also let's comment it out\\nagain\\nand let's focus on our list view Builder\\nnow listview Builder will build on\\ndemand it accepts item Builder which\\nrequires a widget to be returned which\\nis nullable and it gives us build\\ncontext\\nagain and an index now this index is\\nthere because\\nyou need to mention something known as\\nan item count so this list view Builder\\nis basically telling hey we'll help you\\nto build a list of items\\nthat are lazily loaded so it will get\\nloaded as and when you scroll\\nbut you need to mention the item count\\nhow many items there are and the item\\nBuilder so what do you want to build\\nand for that we are giving you the index\\nbecause obviously if you mention the\\nitem count let's say the item count is\\nfive I am giving it a static value\\nhere we are not going to know what to\\nreturn for example I'll return Ali car\\nforecast item but then I have to mention\\ntime temperature icon\\nnow how do I get access to time here we\\nhad I I Plus 1. this is how I would know\\nI'm accessing one particular element\\nfrom the list how can I do it over here\\nthat's why index is present\\njust like there are four Loops I\\nthis is the index that will help us\\nso let's go ahead get the data so we are\\ngoing to have\\nour data Final early forecast\\nwhich is equal to data at least index\\nplus one again we are going to have plus\\none because list view Builder also\\nstarts from zero\\nso we have our early forecast now the\\nfirst thing that I want to return here\\nis DT which is the time so let's go\\nahead and have DT dot to string which is\\njust time in two string then we have\\ntemperature so we are going to have\\nearly forecast\\nthen main then\\ntemp and Dot to string and finally we\\nare going to have our icons I'm just\\ngoing to copy this line I'm not going to\\ntype it again\\nand paste it over here\\nAlso let's uncomment this so to\\nuncomment it I'm going to press command\\nslash\\nand there we go\\nand finally I'm just going to take all\\nof this out in one thing\\nwhich is final\\nearly Sky let's call it that\\nthen we're going to have index plus 1\\nand then\\nif Ali sky is equal to clouds or early\\nsky is equal to rain\\nthen we are going to show the cloud\\notherwise sunny\\nnow you can shift all of these variables\\noutside as well so you're going to have\\nfinal early temperature which is equal\\nto this thing\\nlet's paste it over here then we are\\ngoing to have our date time which needs\\nfurther factoring but as of right now\\nour list view Builder is complete what\\nwe are saying is build five items and\\nthis is what you need to build build Ali\\nforecast items five times and it will\\nonly be visible as and when we scroll\\npress command J and we are received by\\nerrors and a UI that doesn't look quite\\ngood\\nlet's restart\\nand still the UI is still dismantle I\\ndon't know how it's looking like this\\nand we're getting a lot of Errors over\\nhere\\nnow I'll simply tell you the reason you\\ncan go ahead and read the errors\\nbut I'll tell you a simple reason for\\nthis\\nlist view Builder has a tendency of\\ntaking the entire screen size\\nlike you know our text field also has\\nthe tendency of taking the entire width\\nof the screen even less view Builder has\\na tendency to take the entire screen\\nand here\\nwe cannot give it the entire screen\\nobviously because we have this thing\\nover here then we have our additional\\ninformation down below\\nso we have to restrict the height\\nto restrict the height we press Ctrl\\nshift R wrap it with the sized box and\\ngive it a height of 120.\\nif we do that we are restricting the\\nheight to one particular thing you see\\nand now we have our list which is\\nscrollable and it only has a height of\\n120.\\nbut still I want it to be like this like\\nwe had before in the horizontal\\nDirection\\nwe have a nice property for that in list\\nview Builder which is scroll Direction\\njust like we had in a single child\\nscroll view so we are going to pass in\\nscroll Direction access dot horizontal\\nsave it and when you come over here we\\nhave met with an arrow and this error is\\nsolely there because we have set\\nthe list view Builder's height so this\\nlist view Builder entire thing its\\nheight is 120. and it is exceeding the\\ncurrent height\\nwhich is why we are getting this error\\nand it's only there because this thing\\nthis text is going down below that's not\\ngood\\nso what we can do is restrict the text\\nto only be there in one single line so\\nif we go to our Ali forecast item widget\\nscroll down we have our text of time the\\ntext has a property of Max lines if\\nyou'll see\\nhere we can tell how many lines a text\\ncan take maximum and it can only take\\nmaximum of one line and you see the\\nerror is resolved however it Clips\\nthings off and there is no notification\\nabout it like hey we clip this off\\nthere's absolutely nothing told about it\\nso we need to change that so for that\\ntext and has another property which is\\nOverflow\\nso whenever it overflows it will just\\nhave a certain style attached to it so\\nwe have text\\noverflow Dot and it has clip let's see\\nwhat clip looks like\\nthe same thing as we had before dot\\nEllipsis so this will give us dot dot\\ndot which tells hey this is extending\\nthen we have text overflow dot fade so\\nit will just fade in telling you hey we\\nare\\ncutting it off\\nand then we have finally\\nvisible which is just completely visible\\nI like Ellipsis more because it just\\ntells you that hey there's more to it\\nbut we have dots over here\\nanyways now that we have our stuff good\\nour Ali focus is showing our app is now\\nworking based on our weather API\\nwe're almost done only difference\\nis the time that we want to show\\nI told you we are not going to show DT\\nwe are going to show DT underscore text\\nwhich is not what it says it's DT\\nunderscore txt not t EXT and we come\\naway and we see 2023 all of that stuff\\nnow what I want to do is\\nof the entire date given I only want to\\naccess this particular thing only the\\nline\\nso\\nthink how will you be able to do it\\none possible suggestion would be\\nto go ahead and use substring and I\\ntotally agree you can go ahead and use\\nsubstring because it is in the format of\\nyyy\\nhyphen\\nmm hyphen DD\\nso it is going to have a particular set\\nof characters after which you can\\nextract your time and that works fine\\nfor me\\nand maybe you want to use that but I'm\\ngoing to take another approach which is\\nto add a package to our app for this\\nand what is the package well if you go\\nto pub.dev and type intl Intel\\nyou'll see this package and this package\\nis published by dot team themselves\\nsaying they provide internationalization\\nand localization facilities including\\nmessage translation and whatnot\\nbut if you scroll down\\nthey also help with number formatting\\nthey also help fit date formatting and\\npassing which is exactly what we need\\nwe have a date in a particular format\\nand we only want to display the time\\nbased on that\\nso we can go ahead and add Intel to our\\npubspect.aml file now instead of going\\nat the top copying Intel going to\\nperspect.aml file scrolling down\\nand in the dependencies adding Intel\\nlike this there's another thing you can\\ndo\\nnvs code press command shift p\\nthen you have the property of adding dot\\nadd dependency when you search for it\\nyou'll see this and here you can just\\npass in the package name Intel and it\\nwill automatically add it to public.aml\\nfor you run flood up object runs\\neverything\\nand you see Intel is automatically added\\nfor us so you can use this when you want\\nto add packages in Bunch for example I\\nwant to add let's say Intel I want to\\nadd HTTP I want to add multiple things I\\ncan separate them by comma and add\\neverything\\nbut since I've already added I'm going\\nto press escape to escape that dialog\\nsweet\\nso now that I have access to\\ndate formatting\\nlet's go ahead and use it now you can\\nrefer to the documentation that was\\nmentioned earlier but since I've used it\\nbefore date format dot dot pass\\nI don't need reference to it but\\nobviously if you're using it for the\\nfirst time highly recommend to read the\\ndocumentation that is attached over here\\nit will help you to use the package\\nefficiently and properly\\nso the first thing I want to do is take\\nthis and convert it to a date time\\nobject now you remember in our DOT code\\nI had introduced you to date time dot\\nnow like this\\nto demonstrate to you what final\\nvariables were right final time is equal\\nto date time dot now\\nwell exactly we are going to convert it\\nto date time\\nthe string so the string is going to get\\nconverted to date time which we can pass\\nusing Intel package\\nso we're going to have date time dot\\npass and whenever you have anything date\\nrelated I always recommend to use date\\ntime in Florida because it makes your\\njob so much easier\\nespecially when using it with the Intel\\nit will make a lot of stuff easier\\nfor example if you're building WhatsApp\\nand you know on your home screen or in\\nyour chat screen also in the chat bubble\\nyou see the text of the date as\\nmentioned or the time is mentioned\\nhow's that possible\\nhow can we do that in flutter well\\nexactly you can do it over here\\nso let's go ahead first of all and\\nconvert it to date time so we have date\\ntime dot pass and we need to pass in a\\nstring so we have early forecast\\nDT underscore text and then\\nwe are going to use date format which is\\ngiven to us by Intel package make sure\\nit's imported right at the top intel.dot\\nso we are going to update format Dot\\nand we have multiple stuff over here\\nevery month abbr month day and all of\\nthat stuff\\nbut here even down we have functions for\\nthis\\nthis is basically describing how you\\nwant to\\nformat your date time object\\nin my case what I want to do is display\\nit in a format like 0 0 or 3 or 6 or 9\\nor 12 or 15 or 18 like that so for me I\\ncan just use wire\\nso for me I can just use date format.hm\\nand then if I go to hm it basically just\\nhas hm provided to it\\nhm is basically R followed by minute\\nwhich will give me in the format I want\\nare minute right\\nso we have date format.hm dot format and\\nthen I'll pass time to it and format\\nrequires a date time which is why I\\nconverted this string to a date time\\nobject\\nall right now if I do this\\ncome back to the app I have 12 3 6 9 and\\n12 showing up\\nnow you can go ahead and try a bunch of\\nvariations here like HMS and you'll see\\nour minutes second\\nthen you'll have\\nJ let's say and you can try a bunch of\\nthings J is basically 12 am 3 AM 6 AM 9\\nA.M 12 p.m whatever you prefer you can\\nuse that and that will work for you or\\nif you want your custom made you can\\njust update format and you can mention\\nyour own pattern here so if I mention hm\\nyour it will again come back to me like\\nthis\\nor if I mention J like this\\nit will let me know like this so that's\\nthe point\\nthese functions were basically doing\\nthat behind the scenes when you add dot\\nj it was basically calling\\nJ over here\\nso it was calling date format\\nat J what is this this refers to the\\nclass itself this date format so you\\nwere mentioning the pattern itself\\nso you had date format J dot format and\\nthere we go\\nnow we can save it\\nrestart the app and I'm going to go\\nahead with 12 am 3 am I like this better\\nand there we go\\nso app is looking good now the last\\nfeature that I want is whenever I click\\non this refresh icon it should refresh\\nand if there's any update it should let\\nthe user know\\nbecause obviously this is real time only\\nwhen we call it it's not like a stream\\nthat will continuously Give us new\\nupdates and new values when I click on\\nrefresh it will refresh the screen\\nso how do I make sure this refresh\\nhappens Also let's remove the comment\\nfrom here I hope you understand why we\\nwant to use less view Builder\\nit is a better approach overall lazy\\nloading and all of that stuff\\nnow if become aware in our icon button\\nwhat if I just put such date\\nif I put set State what will happen is\\nwhen I refresh\\nit will rebuild the entire scaffold so\\nthat means it will rebuild this entire\\nfuture Builder as well it will call the\\nget current weather function as well\\nthat means this entire build function is\\ngoing to get rebuilt\\nhowever\\nif you check out the flutter official\\nvideo on future Builder now what they've\\ndone and recommended to do is store this\\nin a variable\\nso you'll have final\\nweather which is equal to get current\\nweather\\nor maybe something like this so you have\\nlaid\\nfuture map string comma dynamic\\nweather then you have NH state\\nand once we add in its state we are just\\ngoing to set a late variable whether\\nequal to\\nget current weather all right now I can\\nuse this weather over here instead of\\nweather all right and now you see\\nthe app loads now you might say hey why\\nis this not lazy loading and that's\\nbecause\\nthis is having the type of future we are\\nnot resolving the future we are not\\nusing a weighted await anywhere if\\nyou're not using a weight anywhere we\\nare just saying hey call this function\\nstore the future inside of this variable\\nand then we are calling this variable\\nand when I restart it doesn't give me\\nthe error\\nnow when I restart or refresh this\\ndoesn't work anymore why\\nbecause we are not calling the function\\nanymore we're calling the variable and\\nwhen we call the variable it is not\\nrebuilding again you see so earlier we\\nhad a function and whenever the build\\nbuild function would rebuild this\\nfunction would get called\\nand that is why such State worked\\nearlier when such state was called\\nentire build function was rebuilt so\\nfuture Builder was also rebuilt so this\\nfuture was called the function was\\ncalled and when it is called this thing\\nre-ran and thus we got new values which\\nwere then updated\\nhowever here\\nwe've already called the function over\\nhere\\nokay and the value is present inside of\\nweather\\nand we are just passing the weather\\nvariable here so when such state is\\ncalled build function is rebuilt this\\nweather variable is already there with\\nthe value assigned to it by\\nthe function that was called over here\\nso the function is not getting called\\nagain because such State doesn't call in\\nits state again it just calls the\\nweather variable and whether variable\\nhas the type of future map string\\nDynamic and future Builder is just\\nresolving that future giving us a\\nsnapshot so that we can use the data\\nerror loading and display it on the\\nscreen\\nthat's the job of future Builder but\\nsince there was no function function was\\nnot called it was a variable and\\nvariable already has a value assigned to\\nit it has a value of future map string\\nDynamic assigned to it\\nthat's why it is not getting rebuilt the\\nfunction is not getting called again\\nand thus it is not restarting and\\nflutter always says to use\\nit like this but in our case\\nwe can call get current weather because\\nwe want it to work that way whenever the\\nbuild function is called it should\\nrebuild or what you can do is\\nre-initialize weather\\nto get current weather\\nso if we search State whether is equal\\nto get current weather that means we are\\nre-initializing whether\\nso if we restart we come over here it\\nwill again rebuild for the entire thing\\nso as of now in a simple app there's no\\ndifference between\\nthis thing over here or just calling get\\ncurrent weather and not having this it's\\nthe same thing\\nbut in a bigger app when we get into\\ninherited widget which is in our third\\napp itself\\nand when we talk about State Management\\nyou'll see this build function will get\\ncalled even when\\nsuch state is not called\\nbecause that's the talk about State\\nManagement even such state is a kind of\\nstate of management now I hope your\\nunderstanding what state management is\\nyou know what status and we just have to\\nmanage the state so such state is also\\ntype of State Management but it is\\nrelated to one single screen just like\\nscaffold you know\\nscaffold is there for one single page\\nset state is there for one single\\nstateful widget it cannot manage the\\nstate in\\ntwo to three different screens\\nsuch state will only rebuild one\\nparticular screen it won't go ahead and\\nrebuild a totally unrelated screen if\\nsome data changes\\nthat's where\\nthings like inherited widget and we're\\ngoing to study about riverpod comes in\\nplace\\nthis is just a local State Management\\nsolution\\nand the State Management we are going to\\ntalk about is global State Management\\nbut we'll get to it I hope you\\nunderstood that this is local state\\nmanagement but yeah we are going to dive\\ndeep into it because State Management is\\na very important concept\\nbut anyways you can use whatever I'm\\ngoing to go ahead with the weather\\noption because if you want to expand on\\nthe app's functionalities\\nand I hope you'll do that after you gain\\nthe knowledge of State Management as\\nwell and incorporate State Management\\nthat we learn in the third app over here\\nthis will be more beneficial all right\\nso now let's get\\nto the main.dot file again\\nand here we have seen our app in dark\\nmode Let's go ahead and use theme data\\ndot light\\nif you use that let's see our app looks\\nand this looks quite good\\nI'm not disappointed with the results\\nwe have our card we have everything\\nshowing up nicely\\nlet's switch back to theme data.dog and\\nthis looks nice if I use remove use\\nmaterial 3 to true\\nyou see this looks quite bad in my\\nopinion the layout looks good the\\ncoloring is not fine you know all the\\nborders now have\\nrectangular or pointy edges I don't like\\nthat and if we just have dot light\\nlight doesn't look that bad I am always\\nfond of this color the blue color but\\nstill it's not as good as compared to\\nmaterial 3. all right\\nso that was the difference I wanted to\\nshow you first Theory I want to talk\\nabout is the layout Theory we've already\\nseen the Practical usage of this layout\\nbut\\nsince we've already got a practical\\nexperience I want to give you a\\ntheoretical experience with it and after\\nthat we are going to talk about widget\\nTree Elementary and render objects thing\\nthat I teased about when we were\\nstarting with flutter\\nand we're going to talk about what\\nexactly a widget is\\nokay\\nbut before that let's talk about layout\\nin theory the biggest quote in flutter\\nin terms of layout is constraints go\\ndown sizes go up parent search position\\nwhat does this mean let's go over it one\\nby one the first sentence I said was\\nconstraints go down what does this mean\\nit means that in flutter widgets receive\\nconstraints from their parent widgets\\nconstraints basically means boundaries\\nso widgets receive their boundaries from\\ntheir parent widgets these boundaries\\nDefine the limits within which a widget\\ncan render itself\\neach widget passes these constraints or\\nboundaries down to its child widgets\\nwe've already seen a practical\\nexperience of it with our list view\\nBuilder and a lot more things\\nif we had our\\nlist view Builder it was taking the\\nentire screen size\\nwhat I said over here is wrap it with a\\nsize box give it a height of 120 so that\\nmeans constraints go down\\nthe parent widget size box imposed a\\nrestriction a constrained a boundary on\\nlist view Builder\\nto take only this much height or this\\nmuch space unless you build it the same\\nit gave its child widgets early forecast\\nitem that particular constraints to\\nstrain\\nsince it couldn't stay it gave us a\\nrender flow error in the bottom you\\nremember when the time we had DT over\\nhere instead of\\nDT underscore txt\\nso list view Builder passed it down to\\nits children or child\\nso that is what constraints go down mean\\nsecond thing is sizes go up\\nthis means when a widget receives\\nconstraints from its parent it\\ncalculates its own size based on those\\nconstraints\\nthe widget tries to expand to fill the\\navailable space while respect\\ning\\nwhile respecting any limitations imposed\\nby the constraints this process occurs\\nrecursively up the widget tree where\\neach widget determines its size based on\\nits children sizes\\nand the constraints received from its\\nparent this thing is basically what I\\nhave just explained to you early\\nforecast item took as much height as\\nmuch width as listview Builder and size\\nbox restricted on it\\nsince there was five right term counts\\nit took this much space\\nsince there was access dot horizontal it\\ntook this much space however when I put\\naccess dot vertical it takes the entire\\nscreen size and it implements a\\nscrolling view like this\\nall right so I hope you understood what\\nI meant over here\\nand the last thing here is parent sets\\nposition\\nso after determining the sizes of his\\nchildren\\nthe parent widget decides where to\\nposition each child Vision within its\\nlayout\\nthe parent widget is responsible for\\narranging its children according to its\\nown layout rules and constraints this is\\nwhat we did with the column right\\nI said we could wrap everything with\\nalign widget we could wrap this text\\nwith a line this text with a line this\\ntext with the line this thing with a\\nline and that would work but what I did\\ninstead is in the column set cross\\naccess alignment\\nso that set the position for its\\nchildren and its children were\\neverything that you can see\\nall of these things are children of\\ncolumn\\nso parent widget was responsible for\\narranging the children according to\\ntheir own layout rules and constraints\\nso I hope you understood this\\nthis is a theoretical aspect\\nof it\\nthe Practical I've already shown it to\\nyou and we've implemented it in UI\\nnow you don't have to necessarily\\nremember it unless you're going for\\ninterviews and stuff\\nbut otherwise if you're just building\\nfor yourself practical experience should\\nbe enough\\nso now\\nwe are done with the application\\ncompletely and I've also talked about\\nlayout let's get into some more\\ntheoretical Concepts which are quite\\ninteresting in my opinion so let's dive\\ninto them now let's understand how\\nflutter Works behind the scenes to\\ndisplay something on the UI or to\\ndisplay something on the screen so to\\nunderstand this first we must know that\\nflutter doesn't really translate any of\\nthe widgets into\\nparticular native uis all right so if\\nyou have a button\\nflutter isn't going to say hey you're an\\niOS platform let's convert this to an\\niOS native button if you're an Android\\nproduct isn't going to say hey you're on\\nAndroid I'm going to convert it to\\nAndroid native platform and then display\\nit on the screen no\\nflutter doesn't translate to native code\\nwhat flutter does is paint something on\\nthe canvas using\\nits own rendering back end or rendering\\nsystem\\nthe rendering system it uses behind the\\nscenes is this Kia Graphics engine which\\nis currently being replaced by\\nimpeller\\nthat's why if you come over here when\\nyou run your app and press command J\\nyou'll see\\nusing the impeller rendering backend\\nbecause on iOS the work for\\ntransitioning from this Kia Graphics\\nengine to impeller Graphics engine is\\ndone on the Android it's still being\\nworking on\\nand they'll cover it soon\\nbut for iOS it is done the shift was\\nmade from skiato impeller because skia\\nhad some\\nissues with animation and\\n3D stuff with impeller\\nthings will be better\\nbut anyways\\nflutter doesn't translate to Native UI\\nthat's why if you see over here I can\\nhave an Android E look on iOS\\nright\\nso this allows us to create customizable\\nUI and we can have one UI in all our\\nplatforms irrespective of whether it is\\non\\nAndroid iOS Mac OS web\\nWindows wherever\\nso now let's understand how stuff works\\nso first of all we have our widget tree\\nthe first thing that we have is the\\nwidget tree and we already know what\\nwidget tree is right so let's get it\\nhere type in widget\\ntree and we know what widget tree is we\\nhave already created our own widget tree\\nhere we have my app material app weather\\nscreen and in weather screen we have\\nscaffold app bar\\nicon button future Builder progress\\nindicator if there has to be one\\na text widget if there has to be one and\\nall of that stuff if you want to take a\\nlook at the overall widget tree you can\\nclick on this search kind of Icon over\\nhere\\nand this dialog will only show when\\nyou're running your app so this\\nDev tools widget inspector page will\\nonly be there only when you run your app\\nall right and now you see widget tree so\\nthis tells you your entire widget tree\\nyou can just push this down to see the\\nentire thing so you have root my app\\nmaterial app where the screen scaffold\\neverything displaying\\nand if you open this up a little bit you\\nhave layout Explorer so you have to\\nselect one widget and you'll get a\\nlayout Explorer for that particular\\nthing so this is how your entire UI\\nlooks like\\nscreen\\na scaffold which takes a width of 430\\na height of 932\\nthen you have future Builder which takes\\na width of 430 then it has a height of 8\\nsomething\\nthen you have padding which takes\\nsome constraints and that's what the\\nlayout Explorer is all about you can\\nexplore your layout how your layout\\nstuff is done then you have widget\\ndetails tree\\nwhere you can see the properties that\\nyou've used for every single widget be\\nit padding column whatever\\none cool thing you'll notice over here\\nis something known as render object\\nand that's what our second or the third\\ntree is all about so we have one more\\ntree here so let's paste it\\nand let's call this render\\nobject\\ntree all right so what is this render\\nobject tree we all know what widget tree\\nis Right widget tree will represent the\\nstructure of our UI and it is composed\\nof multiple widgets but what exactly is\\na widget\\nwe know it is the block displaying it on\\nthe screen but what is it\\nwell a widget is just a configuration it\\nis a lightweight object with final\\nproperties\\nvia the properties final because widget\\nis immutable right and we've already\\nseen that whatever is immutable its\\nstate cannot change its properties or\\ndata cannot change\\nthat means widget tree is a very\\nlightweight object that has only final\\nproperties\\nto understand\\nwhy widgets are immutable\\nwe'll have to understand that widget\\ntree doesn't really display anything on\\nthe screen it is just there for you to\\ncompose your UI to tell flutter how your\\nUI should look like flutter will manage\\nall the rendering stuff behind the\\nscenes you'll just tell how you want\\nyour stuff and it will do that behind\\nthe scenes\\nso widget doesn't actually render\\nanything let's just Chuck the widget\\ntree and just focus on widget so let's\\nclose the widget inspector and we are\\ngoing to just focus on one widget and\\nunderstand it for all the widgets\\nand we are going to focus on the text\\nwidget so text extends the stateless\\nwidget right just like any other widget\\nit either extends stateless or stateful\\nwidget\\nso what exactly does text return over\\nhere\\nthe text returns something known as Rich\\ntext if you scroll down you'll find the\\nbuild function\\nyou'll find default textile all of those\\nstuff if conditions then you have widget\\nresult is equal to Rich text\\nthen you again have if conditions and\\nthen you return result\\nso when there are no external properties\\nlike semantics label or registrar setup\\nin your app\\nwhat you return is a rich text so it is\\nsafe to assume that in normal conditions\\nlike us\\nRich Text is being written Now Rich Text\\nis also a widget and I told you that\\nwidgets are just lightweight object\\nproperties and they don't render\\nanything so why are we returning a rich\\ntext well if we press command and go to\\nRich Text source code you'll see which\\ntext doesn't really extend stateless or\\nstateful widget\\nwhat it does extend is multi-child\\nrender object widget\\nand multi-child render object widget is\\na widget to prove that you'll have to go\\ninto the source code see that it extends\\nto render object widget go into the\\nsource code and finally you'll see it\\nextends a widget all right\\nso rich text is a widget but it doesn't\\nextend stateless or stateful it\\nextends multi-child render object widget\\nand that is what our tree is all about\\nrender object 3.\\nnow render objects are of three types\\nor render object widget is of three\\ntypes you can see it over here\\nthe first type if you scroll down is\\nleaf render object widget this is used\\nfor widgets that don't have any child or\\nchildren\\nthen you have single child render object\\nwidget\\nthis is there for widgets that only have\\none child like colored box\\nan example of leaf render object widget\\nis error\\nwidget\\nit doesn't have a child at all it just\\ndisplays itself\\nan example of single child render object\\nwidget is colored box and then we have\\nmulti-child render object widget which\\nis a column because it has multiple\\nchildren right\\nso that is what render object widget\\ndoes the\\nthing that actually displays stuff on\\nthe screen or renders stuff on the\\nscreen is render object what render\\nobject does is it determines the size\\nposition and visual representation of\\nthe widgets that we created or we have\\nand they handle tasks such as layout\\ncalculation painting pixels on the\\nscreen\\nso render object is the thing that\\nactually displays stuff on the screen\\nand does that by calling methods like\\ncreate render object and update render\\nobject so if you just go to the render\\nobject widget it is an abstract class\\nright it has create render object and it\\nhas update render object\\nso this is how it creates and updates\\nstuff on the screen\\nso from what we have learned how stuff\\nhappens is widget tree is there every\\nelement of the widget tree is traversed\\nor it is iterated through or it has gone\\nthrough\\nand then a particular render object\\nwidget for it is created so\\nit is safe to say that widget tree will\\ntell render object tree to create\\nsomething right\\nand that's partially true but what if we\\ncall stuff like such date\\nnow if I unnecessarily call such state\\nin my app what will happen\\nlet's say here I'm not calling weather\\nat all I just do such date I restart and\\nwhen I click on refresh nothing really\\nhappens the widget reads the same\\nnothing additional gets printed on why\\nis that the case that's the case because\\nthere is one more tree in the middle\\nwhich handles all of these things which\\nis the brain of whether render object\\ntree should rebuild or not and that is\\nthe element tree\\nso let's go ahead and create type and\\nelement tree\\nso this Elementary is a reflection of\\nwidget tree and is responsible for\\nmanaging the life cycle of widgets\\nelements are created during the mount\\nphase where they\\nencapsulate the corresponding widgets\\nand store mutable state\\nso basically widget tree goes and\\ncreates a particular element for it\\nand to understand this again let's dive\\nin the source code let's go to text dot\\ndot where our Rich text was\\nand actually let's just exit both of\\nthem and I'm just going to go in the\\ndefinition of\\nstateless widget so let's go over there\\nbecause it's easier to understand there\\nyou see you have stateless widget and\\nthen an override of stateless element\\ncreate element stateless element so\\nevery widget that is there if you go to\\nthe widgets definition you'll find here\\na method which is create element\\nso every widget that is there will\\ncreate an element for itself stateless\\nwidget will go ahead and create\\nstateless element\\nstateful widget will go ahead and create\\nstateful element so every widget will\\ncreate an element for itself and this\\nElementary is does a reflection of the\\nwidget tree so here if you have a\\nstateless widget you're going to have a\\nstateless element\\nnow if I created my app over here I've\\nbasically created my app element\\nI'm going to prove it to you by the time\\nthis section of\\nhow flutter displaced UI Ends by the end\\nof this\\nchapter I'll be able to explain why I'm\\nsaying my app element is going to be\\ncreated\\nbut for now take my word on it\\nevery widget will create an element\\nwhich will be a reflection of itself\\nright and they're only created when you\\nfirst start the app during the mount\\nphase so when you restart\\nyou know this is where elements are\\ncreated\\nand now Elementary is going to take care\\nof whether render object needs to create\\nstuff or it needs to update stuff so\\nwhenever you make changes to the widget\\ntree flutter performs a process called\\nreconciliation or diffing to identify\\nthe differences between the new and the\\nold trees and this process is quite easy\\nbecause widgets are immutable\\nsince magic widgets are immutable all of\\nits properties are final and since the\\nproperties are final\\nit's easier to compare the old widget\\ntree and the new widget tree\\nand this reconciliation process is done\\nso that widget tree doesn't continuously\\njust keep on creating render object\\nwidgets if it does that it will be a lot\\nof performance waste you know\\nso we need to boost the performance we\\nneed to make performant apps for that\\nthe flutter framework needs to be\\nperformed and this is how flutter\\nframework is performed by performing a\\nprocess of reconciliation or diffing\\nso it identifies the differences between\\nthe new and the old trees and whatever\\ndifferences are there only those things\\nget updated or rebuilt for example let's\\nsay my text changes when I have my\\n288.77 Kelvin over here and I restart\\nlet's say this thing over here gets\\nupdated\\nand let's say this text changes over\\nhere to\\n89.0 Kelvin so the render object is not\\ngoing to build every other widget it's\\njust going to build the text or the rich\\ntext again\\nthis way our entire UI is not being\\nrebuilt or let's say our entire UI is\\nnot being repainted again and because of\\nthis\\nwe are getting performant apps\\nto give you proof of this I'm just going\\nto go to the\\nstateless widget again\\nhere I have stateless element right\\nI'm going to go in there we have\\ncomponent element and that finally\\nextends the element so I have element\\nover here\\nand you'll see down in the element that\\nwe have a function\\ncalled as update child and here it\\nchecks if new widget is null or and if\\nthe child is not null then it will\\ndeactivate the child and then it checks\\nif the child is not null then it will\\nperform some some task so basically this\\nfunction update child function is the\\nthing that will perform the\\nreconciliation phase\\nafter reconciliation flutter will\\nperform the layout phase where each\\nrender object will calculate the size\\nand position of the associated widgets\\nand then render object will paint\\neverything on the screen\\nso now I hope you understand why we need\\nthe elementary elementary is an\\nintermediary between the widget and the\\nrender object trees that allows flutter\\nto achieve efficient updates without\\nrecreating the entire UI it will just\\nrecreate one particular UI element or\\none particular\\nobject and\\nand Elementary is the reason why we have\\nfeatures like hot reloading where you\\ncan modify the widget tree and see\\ninstant updates in the running app for\\nexample if I you know change\\nthis to\\ntheme data dot light save it instant\\nupdate happens and everything is now\\nthemedata dot light and if I again\\nchange it everything is instantly theme\\ndata.doc\\nthis Elementary allows it because\\nstuff to update is so less\\nthat you can instantly do it and you can\\ndo it in the running app now hot\\nreloading is a big feature because\\nyou don't have to restart your app when\\nyou restart your app the entire thing\\nrebuilds and because of that\\nyou might lose some very much needed\\nexisting data for example let's say you\\nwere filling a login form and then you\\npress enter and some error occurs you\\nfix that error and then when you restart\\nall of your credentials are gone your\\nemail password everything that you had\\nentered is gone\\nnow you have to refill those again this\\nis this is why hot reloading is a much\\nneeded feature because it saves so much\\ntime\\nso to summarize the widget tree defines\\nthe UI structure Elementary will manage\\nthe widget life cycle and mutable State\\nand render object will handle the layout\\nand painting the elementary will act as\\na bridge between the widget tree and the\\nrender object by performing the\\nreconciliation process which will\\noptimize the updates that need to be\\nmade\\nnow since we've understand what elements\\nare we need to understand what build\\ncontext is now if you come to the build\\ncontext source code you'll see abstract\\nclass build context\\nit has a widget it has owner it has\\nmounted all of its properties\\nbut if you also go to stateless widget\\nstateless element component element and\\nfinally to element you'll see abstract\\nclass element\\nextends something but it implements\\nbuild context so basically element is\\nbuild context or build context is an\\nelement\\nand it makes sense right because\\nbuild context helps us to locate a\\nwidget in the widget tree and what is\\nthe limit\\nelement is acting as an intermediary\\nbetween widget tree and Elementary and\\nrender objectory and every widget\\ncreates an element for itself so it\\nexactly knows the state of the widget so\\nit also knows where in the widget tree\\nor where in the elementary that\\nparticular widget is\\nand build context also knows that so\\nbuild context is actually\\nan element both of them help us to\\nlocate a particular widget in the widget\\ntree\\nthey will help us compare the state of\\nthe widget and see if it needs a rebate\\nand that's why many of the properties on\\nbuild context is similar to what an\\nelement might have\\nfor example if you print context Dot\\nmounted this is a property of element\\nwidget that's a property of element\\nand if you type in element you won't see\\ncreate element method on it\\nbecause build context is an element\\nyou get all of these types\\nand these help us to find particular\\nthings\\nin the elementary now to prove to you\\nthat an element is created a way of what\\nI'm going to do also to prove that build\\ncontext is an element I'm going to print\\ncontext dot runtime type so this will\\ntell me the type of build context when I\\npress command J You'll see the runtime\\ntype of build context is stateless\\nelement now if I take the same thing and\\ngo to\\nweather screen let's scroll down and\\npaste it over here we'll have a stateful\\nelement so build context is indeed an\\nelement\\nand that's a very neat way to handle\\nstuff\\nbecause now they're giving you the\\nelement to access stuff and if you have\\nany\\nthoughts about what the build context\\nruntime type it will be the particular\\nelement it is in so it can be stateful\\nelement stateless element\\nso I hope you understood stuff what we\\nhave covered here is the three trees\\nwidget Tree Elementary and render object\\ntree render object is the thing that\\nlooks after everything\\nrelated to painting Elementary is a\\nmediary which will handle if the render\\nobject needs to be repaint stuff and\\nwidget tree is what we mention over here\\nit's just a simple configuration\\nit is a lightweight object with final\\nproperties and it is immutable because\\nit's so easy and it's so cheap to create\\nthem and to throw them away\\nbecause the element is a manager that\\nwill control everything\\nand element can also handle and control\\nthe widget's location in the tree\\nbecause even build context can do that\\nwe have we've already seen it it also\\nhandles the life cycle of the widget\\nupdating of the render objects and\\neverything\\nso\\nElementary is a big pillar in the flood\\nof framework\\nand we are given access to the element\\nin the form of build context so we have\\nunderstood what build context is\\nprogrammatically and the three types of\\ntrees so this is the shopping app we are\\ngoing to build with flutter we have\\ngoing to have four products displayed\\nover here\\nwith their title price and the image we\\nalso have a custom font for every thing\\nthen when we click on a particular\\nproduct we get directed to a product\\ndetails screen where we again see the\\ntitle The Shoe image the price and the\\nsizes to select from if we don't select\\na size we get a pop-up From Below saying\\nthat we need to select a size\\nthen once we select the size we can add\\nto cart and the product will be added to\\nour card successfully then we can go\\nback come to a cart and we'll see that\\nparticular shoe in a card\\nI can also add more products here let's\\nsay I add Jordans let's say I add 10\\nI'll add to card come back and I see\\nJordan shoes over here now I can also\\ndelete a product from a cart let's say I\\nwant to delete this men's Nike shoes\\nI'll click on delete I get this\\nconfirmation dialog\\nI can either click no or I can click on\\nyes and that will remove the product\\nfrom the cart\\nso this is the app we're going to build\\nand we're going to learn a ton about\\ntheming navigation and State Management\\nso let's dive right into it the first\\nthing that's required is a flutter\\nproject so we are going to go to the\\ndesktop where I'm going to create my\\nflutter project and run the command\\nflutter create let's call it shop\\nunderscore app underscore flutter\\nokay\\nI already have shop underscore app\\ncreated in the desktop which is why I've\\nnamed the shop app flutter then I'm\\ngoing to go to the shop app flutter open\\nit in vs code\\nand then obvious code open I'll close\\nthis for now I'll go to lib main Dot\\nand we have our normal file okay I'm\\nalso going to run it on the iOS\\nsimulator so that\\nwe know that the project is working well\\nand we can confirm it in the meantime\\nI'm going to set up my screen over here\\nso for our own reference I have taken a\\nscreenshot of the simulator and put it\\nhere side by side so that we can have\\nthe app and the US side by side cool so\\nwe need to make this screen like this\\nthing over here\\nso let's clone it so first of all we'll\\nhave to remove the counter app but one\\nthing I want you to note is this color\\nscheme Line This is color scheme color\\nscheme Dot from seed seed Color colors.d\\nPurple okay and also remember the screen\\nbecause I'm going to reference this\\nlater on\\nwhen we add theming to our own\\napplication now let's get done with it\\nlet's remove it then I'm going to create\\nthe stateless widget call it my app then\\nI'm going to return a material app\\nwhere the title is going to be shopping\\napp\\nand the\\nwhom is going to be\\na different widget so I'll have to\\ncreate a different widget I'll go to the\\nlib folder create home underscore page\\ndot dot this is all the boilerplate\\nstuff I hope you are understanding it so\\nI'll have to import material.dot again\\nthen we'll have a stateless widget which\\nwill be called home page and we want to\\nreturn a scaffold\\nso that an empty screen appears that's\\nit\\nI only want to see an empty screen as of\\nnow we'll take it step by step\\nso we have home page returned over here\\nthat is nice\\nand now if I come over here our counter\\napp is now replaced by a blank home page\\nso we have the boilerplate stuff ready\\nnow the next thing I want to do is just\\nstart designing the app but when we\\nstart designing the app you'll realize\\nthat this font is a bit different\\nand the font we generally use in Android\\niOS it's different from what is present\\nover here why let's just take an example\\nof the weather app we created\\nyou see this weather app\\nthe font aware is quite different from\\nthe font mentioned over here so what we\\nneed to do is\\nadd our own custom fonts to the app\\nso there are two ways to do it first way\\nis to use a package called Google\\nunderscore fonts this is provided by\\nmaterial.io\\nwhich is the Google team themselves and\\nwe have it working on all the platforms\\nAndroid iOS Linux Mac OS web windows\\nso what this does is basically a package\\nto use fonts from fonts.google.com and\\nfonts.google.com is like a registry of\\nall the fonts that you can use freely in\\nyour apps\\nyou see it has a ton of\\nfonts you can use\\nand you can use whatever one you want\\nbut the one I'm interested in using is\\nlato so this is the style I'll be using\\nand this is a style which is used over\\nhere as well\\nnow you can explore and find your own\\nfont but I'm going to go ahead with\\nlater\\nnow you can use this font\\nto easily add later to your app\\nall you need to do is mention a text\\nwidget\\nthen you have this text you'll mention\\nthe style then you'll use Google fonts\\nwhich is provided by this Google fonts\\npackage that we'll add to our app dot\\nlater so when you call this later method\\non Google fonts\\nyou'll be able to add the later\\nfont\\nto your app and your app will start\\nlooking different that's all that you\\nneed to do\\nso this package has its own pros and\\ncons the pro over here is it can be used\\nin production to reduce the app size\\nbecause you don't have to install the\\nfont to your\\napp you don't have to install it on your\\nsystem either all you need to do is just\\nuse this and\\nGoogle fonts package will go\\nfetch the font using HTTP at runtime\\nand you'll be able to see it in the app\\nyou see even in the dependencies you\\nhave the HTTP package that one that\\nwe've already used\\nright the con is that it uses HTTP\\nfetching\\nHTTP fetching as we all know can take a\\nlittle bit of time and that delay can be\\nseen when you use Google fonts in your\\napp it is a visible difference but not\\ntoo much\\nso it depends on you if you want to use\\nthis package or not I'm not going to use\\nit\\nI'm going to follow the alternative\\nmethod which is registering the font in\\npubspect.aml file so as we know we can\\nregister the\\nAssets in pubspect.aml file but we are\\nnot going to register assets fonts is\\ndifferent from this thing over here\\nwhen we scroll down you'll see a\\nparticular section is dedicated to the\\nfonts tab we need to use that\\nso you can add custom fonts to your app\\njust using this part and you can add\\nyour images or your video all of that\\nfrom here\\nwe're going to get to assets as well but\\nfor now let's focus on fonts so I'm just\\ngoing to uncomment all of this\\nall of this and make sure indentation is\\nright that means the spacing over here\\nis right because\\nit matters in yaml files\\nthen here we have several things to\\nmention first of all we have to mention\\nthe asset and its location\\nwell we don't have any assets but you\\ncan go ahead and install it from\\nfonts.google.com\\nyou can see your style whichever one you\\nprefer you can select that style it will\\nadd it and once you've selected all the\\nStyles you want just click on download\\nall and it will download it for you in\\nyour system\\nI already have a few downloaded for me\\nso I'll just open them\\nI have later bold and later light which\\nis what I'm going to use if you want to\\nuse the same font style I'll mention the\\nlink for it in the description below\\nso now to register it I'm not going to\\nput these font files in lib folder lip\\nfolder strictly for my DOT code it isn't\\ngoing to have any assets or anything\\nmy assets is going to be present in a\\nseparate folder of its own in the root\\nfolder so I'm going to create my own\\nfolder called assets\\nfonts\\nhere I'm creating two folders because I\\ndon't want to mention ad sets just like\\nthis in the root folder it's quite messy\\nbut I'll create my assets folder then\\nthe fonts folder because\\nI'm going to have two types of assets\\nimages and fonts\\nthe dummy data that there is this image\\nthis is coming from our assets itself\\nwhich are registered in pubspect.aml so\\nwe have to register images as well\\nthat's why I've created the fonts folder\\nnow I can just copy them\\nalso we can open fonts and finder\\nand paste it over here as soon as we\\npaste it in the correct folder you will\\nbe able to see later bold and later\\nlight\\ncorrectly\\nsweet now we'll just have assets slash\\nfonts later light Dot ttf and then we\\nare going to have assets fonts later\\nbold.ttf you need to make sure that this\\npath matches you are in the root folder\\nso you'll go to assets this folder then\\nfonts and then you'll Target one\\nparticular file and make sure you do\\nthat correctly\\nttf it should match word by word letter\\nby letter\\nalso the style here is not going to be\\nitalic it is going to be 700 with a\\nweight you can mention the style it can\\nbe italic or anything else but I want to\\nwant to mention the weight aware because\\nthis little bold font should only get\\nactivated when my weight is 700 and\\nweight 700 means it is bolded and also\\nyou need to mention your custom font\\nfamily name aware so you can go ahead\\nand pass in later later whatever you\\nwant to call it I'm going to call this\\nlater and make sure control s is pressed\\nso flood up object is run and then your\\ncontents of the app is there with you\\nperfect\\nnow we'll go to home page and just to\\nsee if the fonts are loaded properly or\\nnot you can go to body text it\\nand let's say you type in hello world\\nsave it and we have hello world over\\nbut it's in the corner so we are going\\nto center it so I'll press Ctrl shift R\\nthe refactoring options and I'm going to\\nwrap it with the center widget\\nAlso let's put comma for formatting and\\nwhen we come away hello world is seeing\\nbut there is no difference in\\nthe font why because if you again go to\\npubspect.aml file you'll see that there\\nare\\nfonts family and there are\\nmultiple types of fonts you can describe\\nover here you can have more than one\\nfont family described over here\\nso if there are multiple font Families\\nhow will flutter know\\nwhich font family to use and that is why\\nit asked you for the family name over\\nhere\\nthe family name for this font\\nso to make sure you're using the right\\nfont family you need to mention it in\\nthe text so you're going to have Style\\ntextile and textile has a property of\\nfont family and it accepts a string so\\nyou need to mention the font family you\\nmentioned in the\\npubspect.aml file which is later over\\nhere\\nthen save it restart your app and you'll\\nsee a different font is used now\\nif it still doesn't work for you then\\nagain you have to check font family if\\nit's the correct thing if the asset is\\ncorrectly mentioned check your terminal\\ndebug console if there is any error\\nor you might want to terminate the app\\nand restart it again and you'll be able\\nto see the difference\\nso anyways I have font family now if I\\nhave\\nfont weight as font weight dot bold I\\nshould be seeing the bolded textile\\nright and we certainly do\\nnow you might say hey why have we\\nmentioned two font assets over here\\nwhy have you mentioned light and bold\\nboth of them\\nyou can't remove bold right if you just\\nmentioned later you'll be able to use a\\ncustom font and when you use Font weight\\ndot bold it will bold it like this for\\nyou\\nwell let's try it I'm going to remove\\nlater bold\\nrestart the app and you see a visible\\ndifference\\nthe textile and all of that is the same\\nbut still\\nthe style over here for this font\\nchanged\\nthat's because font\\nlater boiled is different from later\\nlight which is bolded in this case what\\nwas happening was later light was bolded\\nso it was less bold however here we are\\nusing later bold which has a distinctive\\nproperty of its own\\nand thus we are using two fonts for one\\nfont family and since we've mentioned\\nweight 700 it is able to identify when\\nto use that kind of font\\nokay\\nsweet\\nnow let's go ahead and design the app\\nwhen we see a wire we have multiple text\\nwe have text over here used we have text\\nover here even here and it's scattered\\nall over the app does that mean I'll\\nhave to use this style textile font\\nfamily later every time I need to\\nuser text and use a custom textile\\nor a custom font family\\nno that can be quite cumbersome just\\nimagine you have to do it over your your\\nevery single place and if your app gets\\nbigger and bigger it will be very\\ndifficult to manage it that's why\\nfont family is generally not used for a\\nparticular text you can Define it\\noverall in your my app in the material\\napp by using the theme property\\nso team will set up the overall\\ntypography in your app and that will\\nwork fine so you mentioned theme data\\nand it has a property of font family\\nwhich you can use it requires a string\\nso mention later where\\nand now without doing anything without\\nmentioning any textile it still uses\\nlater\\nit's not bolded because I removed the\\ntextile font weight dot bowl however if\\nyou bold it it will still work fine\\ncool so now we have set the overall\\ntypography in the app now let's go ahead\\nand set up the overall coloring in our\\napp\\nnow remember in the counter app I told\\nyou\\nto remember one line which was the color\\nscheme line well that's what we want to\\nmention\\nwhat I want to do is set up the overall\\ncolor for my app and I only have one\\nmain color decided which is this yellow\\ncolor what I want is the rest of my\\ncolors the rest of the things\\nused in my app should be derivative of\\nthat\\nso I want to mention just one color and\\nbased on that one color the entire color\\nscheme is going to be generated\\nso we can use that so let's go ahead and\\npass in a color scheme and as soon as we\\ndo that there are multiple arguments we\\nneed to pass in and they are quite a lot\\nyou need to pass brightness primary on\\nprimary secondary on secondary error on\\nerror background on background surface\\non Surface\\nif you don't mention that you'll face\\nerrors\\nso definitely this is quite a cumbersome\\ntask and many people wouldn't want that\\nthey want to develop a symbol app\\nwhere the key focus is\\nbuilding functional app not generating\\nan entire UI so for that we have dot\\ndark which will help you generate a dark\\ntheme\\nthen you have color scheme dot light\\nwhich will help you to generate light\\ntheme but you also have color scheme Dot\\nfrom seed\\nso with this you just have to mention\\none thing the seed color based on the\\nseed color the entire coloring of your\\napp will be set up\\nand it will work fine for you now think\\nof terms of\\na tree\\nfor a tree to grow you need to pass in a\\nseed right this is what it requires you\\npass in a seed and the tree grows\\naccordingly if you pass in a watermelon\\nseed of watermelon thing will be grown\\nif you have a pomegranate pomegranate\\nwill be grown and so on\\nsame way we need to mention a seed color\\nwhich will be the base from which all\\nother colors will be derived all colors\\nwill be based on\\nso Mike Seed color is going to be the\\nyellow color which I've mentioned over\\nhere and\\nI know the RGB o for it so we are from\\nRGB o and then I'll mention 254\\n206 1 1. so this is the RGB for it\\nand opacity is full all right now we\\nhave it over here no visible differences\\nbut we've set the overall theme of our\\napp from\\nfrom seed method we are able to generate\\nthe primary secondary surface colors\\nyou'll see over here using the seed\\ncolor as a starting point a set of tonal\\npalettes are constructed these tonal\\npalettes are based on the material three\\ncolor system and provide all the needed\\ncolors for a color scheme\\nthese colors are designed to work well\\ntogether and meet contrast requirements\\nfor accessibility\\nand if you want to know more about it\\nyou can click over here open it and read\\nabout it in the material 3 design\\ndocumentation\\nokay\\nso now that we have set this up and I\\nthink everything is ready let's go to\\nthe home page and design our app so the\\nfirst thing is we need a header now this\\nheader is a bit different all the adders\\nwe have seen in the past require\\nsomething like this it should be this\\nlong and it should be present over here\\nshoes collection and then you have a\\nsearch box\\nnow this is quite big for an app bar so\\nit's definitely not an app bar that we\\nare going to use we have to custom\\ncreate it whenever you have a header\\nsort of thing it doesn't necessarily\\nmean you have to use an ABBA it will be\\nfine if you don't use an ABBA\\nbut it should match whatever design you\\nhave in mind and make it pixel to pixel\\nso let's go ahead here in the body\\nI'm going to pass in a column and in the\\ncolumn I'm going to mention children and\\nmy first child\\nis going to be a text which will say\\nshoes collection so shoes will be on one\\nline and collection on another\\nso let's go ahead and have text shoes\\ncollection\\nsave it\\nlet's put com up properly so that we\\nhave the right formatting\\nand we have our shoes collection showing\\nup at the top\\nnow what I want to do is put shoe\\ncollections bigger bolded and it should\\nbe right below the notch just like we\\nhave it over here\\nThe Notches over here so it's this font\\nis mentioned over here\\nso I want it below the notch first of\\nall we are going to go ahead and improve\\nthe style so we have textile\\nthen we have font weight as fontway dot\\nbold and font size is let's say\\n35 let's save it and we are going to\\nhave shoes collection over here nice now\\nthe problem is it's quite at the top I\\ndon't want it at the top I want\\neverything starting below the notch so\\nfor this we have a nice widget that we\\nhaven't used till now and that is the\\nsafe area widget so we are going to wrap\\nit so we are going to have Ctrl shift R\\nthe defactoring options and we're going\\nto wrap it with a widget which is known\\nas safe area\\nwhat safe area widget does is it ignores\\nthe\\ntop\\nnotch\\nit avoids the bottom Notch as well or\\nthe bottom\\nbar over here you can see this line it\\navoids that as well\\nso safe area as the name suggests is a\\nsafe area where notches are not there\\nand even these bottom things are not\\nthere\\nnow if you see if this shoes collection\\nautomatically comes down and it looks\\ngood\\nthe next thing I want to do is put\\ncollection right below so I'm going to\\nhave shoes\\nslash n collection\\nI've put backslash n because as we know\\nbackslash n is used to go to a new line\\nwe have seen this in the dot post we'll\\nsave it and we have shoes collection\\nover here perfect\\nthe next thing I want is in the same\\nline as shoes collection I want to put a\\nsearch field so for this we know what\\nwidget to use text field but what we\\nwant is both of them to be in the same\\nline if I mention it below this let's\\nsay I call text field over here and\\nlet's say I do this I have my text field\\nover here perfect right but the problem\\nhere is this is present right below it I\\nwant it side by side\\nso to make it side by side I'll have to\\nwrap text and text field in one\\nparticular widget which is a row\\nso we are going to have row children and\\nthen we are going to have text and text\\nfield\\nput it inside save it\\nand now we have it but the text field\\nisn't showing up why is that the case\\nwell that's the case because if you\\npress command J\\nand let's say you restart your app you\\nhave a bunch of Errors showing up\\nand\\nif you want you can go ahead and read\\nthis error to understand what really is\\nhappening but if you don't understand it\\ndon't worry basically I've told it to\\nyou before that text field occupies\\nmaximum width it can get\\nit takes in as much width\\nas a device has\\nso here in a row it is not getting\\nas much width as the device has because\\nthe text is present over here so it's\\noverlapping and thinking hey why am I\\nnot getting\\nthe maximum width or you can say the\\ndevice width\\nthat's why we need to constrain the text\\nfield\\nso that it only takes as much space as\\nit's told it doesn't go ahead and take\\nthe entire device with that's not\\nallowed\\nagain if you didn't understand just to\\nexplain it to you\\nthe text field has a tendency of taking\\nas much width as possible on the device\\nthat is why when we had mentioned text\\nfield in a column below\\nit took the entire device with but here\\nwhen we put it inside of a row it\\ndoesn't get the entire device width it\\nonly gets this much width which is not\\nacceptable by it\\nbecause this text is taking some space\\nso we need to tell it that hey you need\\nto be fine with this much space you're\\ngetting\\nso for that we'll have to wrap text\\nfield with a widget and that is the\\nsized box widget here we are going to\\nmention the width let's say\\n50 maybe that is enough\\nand then we can save it so we have text\\nfield showing up which is quite small 50\\nis quite a small width so maybe we want\\n250\\nand this is still not enough maybe 270\\nand you see we get an error a render\\nflow error\\noverflowed by one pixel\\nso maybe we want 269 but I'm going to go\\nahead with 260.\\nso here's the problem now if I mention\\n260 here\\nit will be different on a pixel emulator\\nso let's get a pixel emulator up and\\nrunning and see how it looks on the\\npixel emulator as well\\nand then we'll be able to decide if it\\nworks fine on all device sizes or not\\nif it works fine on all device sizes\\nthen we are good with 260 otherwise they\\nneed to be made some changes so pixel\\nemulator is now up and running and as\\nyou can see we are getting a render flow\\nerror on the pixel screen\\nso that goes to say that the pixel size\\nthat we have mentioned over here doesn't\\nwork for this case so let's just remove\\nthe size box and think of some other\\nsolution whatever width we mention is\\nnot going to be the same for both\\nAndroid and iOS or for different screen\\nsizes in general\\nso let's just generalize this problem\\nwhat do we want we want this text field\\nto take as much space as possible after\\nthis shoes collection has taken its\\npeace\\nso what we can do first of all is take\\nthis text put it in a padding widget so\\nthere's padding all around it and after\\nthat\\nwe can tell search or text field to take\\nas much space space as available\\nso what I'm going to do is press Ctrl\\nshift R get the refactoring options wrap\\nit with padding so we have constant\\nagencies.all but it is not enough I want\\nit to shift quite a bit so maybe I can\\nshift it to 20 and this looks better\\nafter that in the text field I'm going\\nto use another widget\\nwhich is called as expanded\\nwhat expanded does and it is generally\\nused in either a row or a column is\\nit just tells hey take as much space as\\nmuch width as possible it doesn't say\\nhey take the entire device with it says\\njust take as much space and width as\\npossible in this row or in this column\\nwherever you're defining it and now on\\nboth this devices it takes the same\\nspace there's the padding of the text\\nwidget\\nand after that it has its own text field\\nright so it works on all screen sizes\\nso that's the cool thing about using\\nexpanded you don't have to use pixels or\\nyou don't have to mention any height\\nwidth Etc you can just use expand it to\\ntell hey just take as much space as\\navailable in a row or a column\\ncool now that we have this let's go\\nahead and Define or Design This search\\nfield and I'm going to keep the pixel\\nemulator on the side as long as it's not\\nbothering me\\nnow let's go ahead and create the search\\nso what do we want well first of all I\\nwant this text to appear and it should\\njust be a hint a label wouldn't look\\ngood right if you have search written\\nover here and when you click on it the\\nsearch will go on the top we won't we\\ndon't want that kind of label\\nwe do want hint text so we'll go to the\\ntext field we already know we'll pass in\\na decoration input decoration and the\\nhint text is going to be what search\\nand if we do that much and let's come\\nover here save it we have search written\\nover here that's nice\\nnow I want to bold this text because the\\ntext is not bold and maybe I want to\\nreduce its height as well\\nso for that I can do it over here in the\\ninput decoration itself but the problem\\nhere is\\nwhenever I want to create a text field I\\nwant this kind of design I don't want\\nanything else I want this text to be\\nbolded\\nI want my\\nstuff as it is for every single text\\nfield I create so that's why what I'm\\ngoing to do is go to the main dot dot\\nand in the theme I'm going to define the\\ninput decoration so every time I create\\na text field or I use input decoration I\\nwant a similar kind of theme so I'm\\ngoing to have input decoration theme and\\nthis doesn't ask for just input\\ndecoration it asks for input decoration\\ntheme so let's go ahead and pass it in\\nand let's mention the thing that we want\\nan input decoration theme I want the\\nhint style to be given a proper style so\\nwe are going to have textile\\nand here the font weight first of all is\\ngoing to be there so we are going to\\nhave font weight dot bold and then we\\nare going to have font size which is 16.\\nso this is now bolded and looks better\\nin my opinion\\nlet's put it over here also let's put a\\nconst here and for the home page as well\\npeel product cons that's nice\\nthe next thing we want is an icon\\nso obviously we know what to use prefix\\nicon because we want it in the front if\\nyou've ordinated it in the back we would\\nuse suffix icon but let's go ahead with\\nprefix icon and here we can mention our\\nicon we already know how to use the\\nicons class so we have icon icons Dot\\nsearch\\nand just to clarify icons dot search\\nis icon data and this is a widget you\\ncannot just use icons dot search aware\\nbecause icons doesn't extend the widget\\nclass\\nso we need to wrap it with icon which\\ntakes in an icon data and icons is\\nan icon data all right\\nlet's save it come away and we have this\\nnow what I want is\\nthe color to be same\\nso\\nagain for all my\\ntext Fields I want the icon color to\\nremain the same so I'll come in the\\ninput decoration theme and have prefix\\nicon color color dot from rgbo\\nand here I'm going to mention a color\\nwhich we have found out one one nine one\\none nine one one nine one\\nso this color is kind of grayish\\nand you won't see big differences but it\\nthere is a difference\\nso for every text field I create this is\\ngoing to be the theme data I can\\nobviously override it\\nfor example if I just override the color\\nover here let's go ahead and type in a\\ncolors.red\\nthe color is now red so you can override\\nit but if you don't pass anything it\\nwill take the default theme from here\\nand this will only match particular\\nthings for example input decoration hint\\ntext style can be passed over here and\\nit will follow that if you pass in a\\nlabel style only label will follow this\\nparticular property not hen Style\\nso if you pass anything over here for\\nexample a color or anything it will\\nfollow that and if you don't pass\\nanything the default will be what you\\nmentioned in the theme in the theme data\\nnow the next thing is to put borders\\nover here and to put a border it can be\\na bit different\\nfor every text field we create for\\nexample in the home screen I want I\\ndon't want a text field like this\\nbecause here the text field is like this\\nit goes straight then there's a curve on\\nthe left and then it again goes straight\\nso I don't want this kind of\\ntext field border for every text field\\nwe create\\nthat's why I'm not going to mention it\\nin the theme data I'm going to mention\\nit right over here\\nso yeah I'm gonna go ahead and add\\nborder\\nin the decoration I need to add sorry\\nborder and that will include border\\nlike this but this is an abstract class\\nyou already know so we can use outline\\ninput border\\nor you can use an underline border I\\nwant an outline input border because I\\nwant a clear background or clear border\\nlike this\\nthen I'm going to have Border Side where\\nBorder Side is Border Side like this\\nthe color will be there and color will\\nbe color dot from rgbo 225\\n225 225 and one this is another color I\\nfound out from the figma design\\nso we can paste it over and don't worry\\nabout the warnings as of now if we just\\nput one constant over here the errors\\nare gone but\\nwe can't be sure about it yet because\\ntext field requires a controller and\\ncontroller cannot be a constant so I'm\\nnot putting it as of now\\nso there we go we have our Border Side\\nready as well\\nnow if we come over here we are able to\\nsee stuff\\nnow what I want is the Border radius to\\nbe present so let's go ahead and pass\\nthe Border radius\\nso we are going to have bought a radius\\nborder radius Dot\\nhorizontal\\nyou can also use water radius dot\\ncircular but that will be for everywhere\\nI only want it from the left that's why\\nI'm going to use border radius Dot\\nhorizontal of course you can also use\\nonly but then you'll have to set top\\nleft\\nand bottom left both because you want a\\ncurve from your and a curve from here\\nbut I know I want it from the horizontal\\ntotally so I can just mention left here\\nand let's say I pass in a radius dot\\ncircular of 50. cool now we can save it\\nwe come over here and we have our border\\nradius looking good only from the left\\nhand side not from the right hand side\\nif we add right as well\\nlet's try it out we have something\\nlooking like this and this might be good\\nfor other text fields that we create not\\nfor this so we are going to have a\\nsimple left like this nice this looks\\nnice now the problem is the color isn't\\nexactly what I mentioned\\nso I've mentioned the Border over here\\nbut this color is quite different from\\nwhat is over here it is taking the\\ndefault color so what I'm going to do is\\npush this border out\\nand I'm going to have final border which\\nis equal to border just like we did in\\nthe\\ncurrency converter app as well remember\\nand we're going to put a constant here\\nbecause this is a constant\\nthen we can pass border over here then\\nwe can have enabled border\\npass the Border same way and now you see\\nthe design changes enable border is this\\nborder and focus border is the border\\nthat we see right now\\nso focused border has a predefined color\\nand it has a predefined color because of\\nthis\\nseed color\\nwhen we passed in color scheme Dot from\\nseed it generated a design theme of its\\nown using which\\nit is giving us this color it thinks\\nthis is a nice color with seed color as\\nyellow\\nso let's just remove it and see you see\\nas soon as I remove seed color it's now\\nblue the default theme\\nthat's why I've mentioned seed color\\naware so that it can generate on its own\\nbut I still don't like\\nthis border color over here\\nso what I can do is pass in focused\\nborder and pass the border to it as well\\nso when it's in focus\\nwe get the same overall theme let's\\nrestart and\\nthat restarts it only for iOS not for\\nAndroid\\nso let's go ahead and restart it for\\nAndroid as well\\nnow we have restarted and everything\\nlooks great\\nso this is nice\\nwe are creating uis that will fit\\neverywhere that's nice the next thing I\\nneed is is this chip\\nor you can say these filters\\nso\\nthere are two options we can take here\\nfirst one is creating a list of filters\\nthen using list view Builder that we\\nhave already seen on the weather screen\\nand displaying it over here that sounds\\nnice right so let's do it we'll go to\\nour code\\nand for now let's just wrap everything\\nin a const after\\nwe start building stuff the text field\\nmight need a controller so we can put it\\nthen\\nso what I'm going to do is\\nDefine a list so I'm going to have final\\nlist of string filters of companies and\\nthen I'm going to have a list but as\\nsoon as I create this I can't Define a\\nconstant Constructor because the field\\nfilters is initialized as a non-constant\\nvalue so I can put Constable here and\\nthat fixes everything because list like\\nthis is a constant but I have what I\\nwant is the company names to be present\\nin the filters so first of all I'll\\nmention it I'll have all then I can have\\nadded us then I can have Nike and then I\\ncan have bought out\\ncool now have all of those filters now I\\ncan use a list view Builder to display\\nthem on the screen\\nso let's have\\na list view Builder this will take in a\\ncontext and an index\\nthen we can have an item count and as\\nyou can see as soon as we put a list\\nview Builder we get errors all over the\\nplace and that's because listview\\nBuilder is not a constant so let's go\\nahead remove it and add a constant for\\nevery single widget\\nthat looks nice\\nnow in item count what is our item count\\nwell whatever or how many filters are\\npresent over here\\nmy filters here are filters dot length\\nand this crosses my mind that yeah you\\ncould use a row here to display these\\nwidgets but again if you have more\\ncategories or more filters in the future\\nfor your application not just four\\nthings maybe you have a fifth brand Puma\\nor something as well you want to add it\\nyou can do that by just mentioning the\\nvalue over here and everything else will\\ntake care of itself\\nyou only have to update the value over\\nhere you don't have to go like hey\\nsince I added one value I'll have to add\\none more widget no filters.length will\\ntake care of it\\nbecause you are specifying the value as\\nlet's say this is 4 so it will build\\nfour times if you add a Fifth Element it\\nwill build five times and it will build\\naccording to the data we pass and the\\ndata I want to pass in over here is\\nthese name of the companies only\\nso let's go ahead now how do I create\\nthis kind of UI right this looks quite\\ninteresting\\nso to create this kind of UI there is a\\nwidget you can obviously go ahead and\\nuse the container to create this kind of\\nlayout\\nand that's totally possible but flutter\\nmakes our life easier by providing us\\nwidget for it\\nand that is the chip widget when you\\nreturn a chip you just have to provide\\none label and\\nit will create a chip out of it chip is\\nthis thing only\\nof course you can create a container and\\nmake it do your work but there's a\\nwidget for it and there are so many\\nwidgets that I won't be able to cover\\nall of them in this course so you need\\nto constantly look up for yourself\\nif you have a doubt you can ask it on\\nGoogle\\nor on our Discord server and you'll be\\ngetting help for it\\nbut if there is no specific widget for\\nit you can create your own combination\\nof widget and get it working\\nanyways coming back to the label what is\\nour label well it's these texts only so\\nI want filters at index whatever we are\\nbuilding for\\nso we are going to have final filter is\\nequal to filters at index then I'm going\\nto have the label which requires a\\nwidget so I'm going to pass in a text\\nwhich will be a filter save it we come\\nover here\\nand we see nothing why let's open the\\ndebug console and we again have an error\\nand this error is quite similar to what\\nwe had before when we laid out a text\\nfeed\\nthe problem is the same list view\\nBuilder wants to take the entire height\\nof the screen and you're not giving it\\nthat now if I\\nremove this thing also I think I've made\\na mistake here\\nI should not be passing in a row\\nI should be passing it out of the column\\nnow this is a mistake you need to\\nunderstand this\\nI had passed in a row\\nokay so it consisted of these two things\\nit consisted of these two things in a\\nrow now what I want is an element over\\nhere so I need to pass it in a column\\nwhich I have already created right I\\nhave a column over here\\nso I need to mention my chip or my list\\nview Builder out of this widget of row\\nokay\\nso I can come down over here\\nI've put the list view Builder but the\\nproblem Still Remains the Same it wants\\nthe entire height of the screen and it's\\nnot getting the entire height of the\\nscreen\\nso now we want to restrict the height so\\nfor this we have already seen we can use\\nsize box now if I use expanded over here\\nand save it yeah I do see stuff but\\nwhat's happening is it's taking the\\nentire width of the screen I don't want\\nit to take the entire height of the\\nscreen in any case I only wanted to take\\nas much height as I tell it to take\\nso what I'm going to do is wrap it with\\na sized box instead and then I'm going\\nto mention a height of let's say 120\\nthen save it and I have this now you see\\nI have a scrollable list of filters\\nnow I'm going to go here and pass in a\\nscroll Direction which will be access\\ndot horizontal so everything is\\nhorizontal now but we need a padding\\nlike a margin sort of thing that we have\\nhere between every chip so let's add\\nthat we're going to wrap chip with a\\npadding widget\\nand if I do constant Edge and such dot\\nall it will be from all the sites I only\\nwant it from the horizontal side I don't\\nwant it from the vertical side right\\nso I'm going to have dot symmetric I can\\nuse dot only left 8 and write it but\\ndoes the same as doing Dot symmetric\\nhorizontal 8. I hope you're getting it\\nwe've already discussed about this but\\nI'm still clarifying in case you didn't\\nunderstand it then and here we have our\\nwidgets showing up perfect now I only\\nwant to increase their\\nheight\\nnow to increase their height what should\\nI do\\ndoes Chip have a height property let's\\nsee\\nit doesn't have anything height or size\\nrelated\\nso what I need to use is a padding\\nto increase the height of the\\nchip I'm just going to increase the\\npadding around it so it increases the\\npadding\\nand this will become bigger\\nso to I've already passed in a padding\\nover here right and it looked at the\\noutside it didn't look at the inside of\\nthe chip widget\\nand that's why chip also has a padding\\nproperty of its own\\nyou can pass that in so you have padding\\nEdge and sets Dot\\nthen you can pass in all or symmetric\\nwhatever you want if I pass an agent\\nsearch dot all 15.\\nthis looks good not bad but the problem\\nI have with it is\\nit's not looking as good as I want it to\\nlook so what I'm going to do is I'm\\ngoing to increase its padding from the\\nhorizontal side and make it different\\nfor the vertical side so that will give\\nme a better feel of it\\nso what I'm going to do is Edge in such\\ndot symmetric then I'm going to have\\nhorizontal as 20 and vertical as 15.\\nsave it also put Constable here and\\nthere we go\\nthis looks much better and is as similar\\nas this right\\nbut yeah the text is quite small so\\nlet's make the label style bigger we\\nhave label here so we can either pass in\\na style over here or a label style for\\nit so we have label style and then we\\ncan have textile\\nfont size 16.\\nthen also put a const around it save it\\nand become aware and this looks better\\nit is scrollable over here it might be\\nextending\\nthis part and that is why we are not\\ngetting an error if we wrapped it with a\\nrow we would get an error and then we\\nwould have to wrap it with a single\\nchild scroll view what we've seen in the\\nweather app before\\nbut anyways coming back to this this\\nlooks nice\\nthe last problem or the second last\\nproblem is the color so let's change the\\ncolor and for every chip that I create\\nI want a particular color to be present\\nso I can change the chip color from here\\nI'll pass in the background color and\\nthe background color can be\\nconstant color dot from rgbo and then\\nyou mentioned the rgbo which will be 245\\n247\\n249 and 1. then we save it you come over\\nhere and we see the similar coloring now\\nobviously this looks a bit different\\nfrom this one but if you take a\\nscreenshot save it away and get it side\\nby side\\nboth of them will look similar just to\\nmake this look more prominent what I'm\\ngoing to do is add a border as well so\\nyour chip also allows us to pass in\\nsomething known as a side and we already\\nknow what Border Side does it will help\\nus to create a border of a particular\\ncolor so I can pass in a border side\\nwhich will have a color of the same\\nthing as this one so I'm going to have\\nconstant color as this also let's put a\\nconstier\\nsave it become aware and this does look\\nmore prominent okay\\nand the last thing I want to do here is\\nmake the Border radius more curved\\nso I want this to be more curved just\\nlike this one so I can decrease the\\nBorder radius\\nso for that we also have another\\nproperty which is the shape that will\\nallow us to do that so we have rounded\\nrectangular border where you can mention\\nborder radius and that will be border\\nradius dot circular\\n30. it's all tried and tested values all\\nright when I was building the app for\\nthe first time I tried values like 10 15\\n20 30 and whichever one I liked I kept\\nit and I like 30 so here it is and this\\nlooks\\nexactly like this one all right\\nnow the next thing I want to do is the\\nselection of this chip so whenever I\\nselect a particular chip\\nI want that particular chip to have a\\nyellowish color so for this my plan is\\nvery simple\\nI obviously need to know what filter is\\nselected so that I can filter\\naccordingly so I need to know that yeah\\nall is selected so I want to show all\\nthe products I want to know added also\\nselected so that I can filter all the\\nAdidas products and so on so I\\ndefinitely need to know that what filter\\nwas selected so I need to store the name\\nof this filter so I'll be using a string\\nto store my state\\nafter that you know whatever is clicked\\non I can just use gesture detector to\\nknow which one was tap and then save it\\nin my state\\nso for that I'll have to convert this\\nfrom a stateless to a stateful widget\\nlet's do that\\nthen I'm going to create another\\nvariable which is string selected filter\\nand that will be equal to filters at\\nzero but when I try to do this it says\\nthe instance member filters can't be\\naccessed in an initializer\\nit basically means that hey you've\\ncreated the list of filters over here\\nand now you're saying you want to use\\nfilters at zero you can't use an\\ninitialized value again in to initialize\\nsomething else\\nso what you can do instead is use late\\nstring selected filter and then use NH\\nState because this is the first thing\\nthat calls before the build function\\nand then we can set selected filter\\nequal to filters at zero and that will\\nwork fine\\nokay all right\\nnow what I'm going to do is take\\nselected filter and whenever I tap on\\nthe chip so let's see if tab has Chip\\nHazard on top property\\nand it doesn't\\nso we'll have to wrap the chip with a\\ngesture detector widget now here's the\\nquestion should I wrap the gesture\\ndetector property with chip\\nor should I wrap padding with gesture\\ndetector\\nmeaning gesture detector should be used\\nlike this like wrap with Widget gesture\\ndetector should be used like this\\nlet's see if I use on tap and let's say\\nI just print hi\\nif I do this press command J\\nlet's restart the entire app\\nand we'll do the same for iPhone as well\\nwe'll come away and let's say we select\\nadded us High gets printed that's\\ncorrect but if I print\\noutside of added off let's say over here\\nit still prints why because you've\\nwrapped it around a padding widget what\\npadding does is it's saying that\\nthis particular thing this part is One\\nwidget this part is One widget\\nit is not just including this particular\\nwidget it is also including stuff on the\\nside\\nbecause that's what padding does padding\\ncreates\\na spacing\\nan empty spacing from the left and the\\nright hand side\\nso that's what padding is doing and in\\nclosing it with a gesture detector\\nyou're saying that whenever I click over\\nhere\\nI want a particular filter to be\\nselected and that's not how my app is\\ngoing to work my app is going to work\\nonly when the chip is clicked on so I'm\\ngoing to remove the gesture detector\\nfrom your I'll press command Z\\nthen I'll wrap the chip widget with a\\ngesture detector\\nand then I'm going to have on tap\\nprint let's say hi\\nthen I come over here I click on added\\nas it prints but when I click outside of\\nadded auth it is not printing cool\\nso it was a very minor\\nthing but it definitely helps to improve\\nthe logic\\nyo so coming back to what I wanted to do\\nselected filter should be equal to the\\nfilter we have over here right so you\\nhave selected filter which is equal to\\nfilter save it\\nand\\nyeah we've just made short selected\\nfilter is changed now I want the\\nbackground color to change according to\\nwhat the selected filter is\\nso if selected filter is equal to filter\\nso if selected filter what we have\\nselected is equal to the filter that we\\nare on so if added off is there and it's\\nclicked on the selected filter and the\\nfilter is the same thing so I want the\\nyellow color to be there so if selected\\nfilter is equal to filter then I want\\nthe yellow color\\nand whenever you find yourself repeating\\nmany colors what you can do is set up\\nthe theme for it now I want to access\\nthe seed color so what I can do is theme\\ndot of context\\nDot color scheme dot seed color but\\nthere's nothing like seed color given by\\ncolor scheme then what should I use\\nthat's the point of seed color scheme\\nDot from seed is basically like hey\\ngive me a seed and I'll build everything\\nbased on it\\nthere's no seed color in color scheme\\nclass\\nin this class of color scheme there's\\nnothing like\\nseed color so we cannot use it what can\\nwe use well we can try to use primary\\nright and when we come aware the primary\\nis quite different from what I wanted my\\nprimary to be\\nmy primary was supposed to be yellow\\nbut it's not yellow\\nbecause we have built from seed so when\\nwe have built from seed adjusters it has\\npredefined some colors that will look\\ngood and it thinks this is a good color\\nfor a chip and I disagree I wanted\\nsomething else so what I can do here is\\noverride the existing color\\nso I'll just say the primary color\\nshould also be this and when I do this\\nand let's say I restart my app you see\\nyellow color is there and it looks good\\nI'll restart it on Pixel emulator as\\nwell\\nand you see it looks nice\\nso again to explain what happened over\\nhere\\nwe generated from seed seed color is\\njust there so that it can build stuff\\nfor you\\nit can build colors for you and\\nautomatically assign them so it\\ncreated the primary color also for you\\nbut I didn't like the primary color\\ngenerated so what I did was replaced it\\nwith my own primary color\\nand here is my primary color rest of the\\nthings like secondary color or\\nsurface color all of that can be defined\\nby this color scheme only I only want\\nthe primary color here to change and\\nthen to access it what I've done is\\ntheme.off context dot color scheme dot\\nprimary to understand how this works\\nbehind the scenes I'm going to\\ndemonstrate or create a diagram for you\\nand once we understand theme dot off\\ncontext.color scheme.primary like how is\\nthis actually fetching this primary\\ncolor we'll understand the basics of\\nState Management the basic principles of\\nState Management in flutter so this is\\nhow it works let's say you have a root\\nwidget and the root of your widget is\\nthis all right and here I'm going to\\nhave root written so this is the root of\\nour widget and let's put the root widget\\nyeah this looks good\\nand the root widget is followed by our\\nwidget tree so we have one widget over\\nhere and let's say there are multiple\\nother widgets and then every widget has\\nits own sub widgets as well like column\\nit has multiple children so you can have\\nthose as well\\nlet's say this is our entire widget tree\\na very simple demonstration all right\\nand let's say this is our material app\\nso after root we directly have our\\nmaterial app\\nin the material app we have set up the\\ntheme and all of that stuff so we have\\nall the stuff related to\\ntheming all right\\nnow material lab behind the scenes\\nconfigures all of the theme related\\nstuff and sets it up globally for your\\nentire app so it does that behind the\\nscenes so it has all the theme related\\ndata over here so let's call this theme\\ndata now in some descending widget let's\\nsay in this widget\\nwhat I've done is called our\\ntheme dot off context right this is the\\nmain part theme dot off context\\nby calling theme dot off context you're\\ntriggering something known as inherited\\nwidget so if we just come over here to\\nthe home page go to theme\\nwe see a stateless widget but when we go\\nto theme dot off context\\nwe have inherited theme and if we go to\\ninherited theme it extends a narrated\\ntheme and inherited theme extends\\ninherited widget\\nso we are using something known as the\\nnarrated widget which we've talked about\\na lot\\nwhenever we talked about widgets so\\nthere are three types of widgets\\nstateless stateful and inherited\\nbut we never got the opportunity to say\\nthat\\nwhere do we use an edited wizard this is\\nwhere you use a narrated widget\\ninherited widget is used for State\\nManagement by the flutter framework\\nwhenever it wants to talk to the parent\\nwidget as of now we've seen that\\nwhenever we want some data to be passed\\nto the child how we do that is by\\nConstructor so if material wants to give\\nsomething to our home page it will pass\\nit through the Constructor if home page\\nwants to give something to some other\\nwidget it will pass it through the\\nConstructor again if it wants to pass\\nsomething to the Constructor it can do\\nthat but how will we do it in reverse\\nfor that State Management is there and\\nanother problem here is what if my\\nmaterial app doesn't want to keep\\npassing everything to the build function\\nor through the Constructor right every\\ntime it has to go through the\\nConstructor that is quite cumbersome\\nwhen you have a large widget set\\nright now we only have four so it\\ndoesn't matter\\nfor you but later on when we have bigger\\nwidget tree you'll say hey this is such\\na bigger budget tree do I have to pass\\nit through the Constructor every single\\ntime and this is where inherited widget\\nwill help you inherited widget will just\\nsay hey you want me to pass some data\\ndown to the widget tree you can pass it\\nto any widget like this\\nso it will just skip it it will skip all\\nthe Constructor part and it will\\ndirectly have\\nthe data given to it so this is what\\ntheme dot off context does it will just\\ntell the parent\\nwidget whenever it sees the theme widget\\nit is just going to go there and grab\\nthe data from it to repeat what I said\\nhow theme dot off context works is it\\ngoes up the widget tree and starts\\nfinding the nearest theme widget as soon\\nas it finds a nearest theme widget\\nit will grab the properties of it and\\nuse whatever is necessary so if team\\ndata was mentioned over here\\nlet's say theme data was also present\\nover here and team data was also present\\nover here both the places so theme dot\\noff context is directly going to go to\\nthis theme data it won't go to this\\ntheme data it won't go because it will\\nfind the nearest theme data widget for\\nit\\nthat is how team.off context works so\\nbasically what team dot off context does\\nis find its nearest widget its nearest\\nancestor widget of the same type since\\nthis is team it will also find theme\\nlater on we'll see stuff life now like\\nNavigator dot off context\\neven then what it does is\\nfind the nearest Navigator widget\\nand use that to display its routes or\\nyou know do its navigation stuff but\\nwe'll get to it but this is how team.off\\ncontext works and this is how inherited\\nwidgets work\\nwe are not going to write code in\\ninherited widget if you want to do that\\nI'll mention a resource below which is\\ncreated by the flutter team themselves\\nand that will provide you with a clear\\ndescription however what I'm going to do\\nis just explain how theme data works\\nso if you've understood you can skip it\\nand if you've not understood I'm going\\nto explain it again how this works is\\nwhenever you call theme dot off context\\nthis off context goes ahead and Finds\\nIts nearest ancestor widget\\nso it will go and search for any theme\\nwidget that is nearest to it and once it\\nfinds it we get theme data it will use\\nthe properties mentioned over there\\nsuppose if theme data is not mentioned\\nover here\\nit will go to the root widget to find\\nthe theme data\\nand even if it's not mentioned in the\\ntheme data root it will still have it\\nbecause material lab behind the scenes\\ndoes create a theme data if you want to\\nmention it\\nand change it you can change it but if\\nyou don't mention and change it\\nthen it will use the default theme the\\nblue color theme or the pink color theme\\nit has already created all right so I\\nhope you understood this explanation\\nthis is what it does this is inherited\\nwidget and this is how State management\\nin general works with flutter\\nwe are going to take a look at a similar\\nthing in Navigator as well I'm going to\\nexplain it then\\nso if you didn't understand it now an\\nopportunity will be later on however I\\nwould still recommend you to understand\\nit right now so coming back to this we\\nhave selected filter is equal to filter\\nand when we have this it will have a\\ncolor scheme dot primary so it goes and\\nfinds its nearest theme data widget it\\nfound it and then it will access its\\ncolor scheme primary widget perfect\\nnow if I try to change it it doesn't\\nchange why well that's because the\\nselected filter is equal to filter but\\nyou've not called set state\\nwhen we have not called such State\\nhowever there\\nwidget rebuild that's why we need to\\nwrap it with a such state so that the\\nbuild function rebuilds and then we can\\nproperly select a particular widget\\nperfect now that we have this done as\\nwell\\nlet's just get rid of the warnings by\\nprotecting a const over here\\nnow the next thing after the list view\\nBuilder and the size box in the column\\nis displaying these cards\\nour data so let's save it let's close\\nall the save files I'm going to go in\\nthe lib folder and create a new variable\\nor a new file called Global\\nvariables.dot and this contains my\\nGlobal variables and file\\nand my Global variable\\nis the dummy data that I want so my\\ndummy data is going to be a list of maps\\nstring comma Dynamic so it is going to\\ncontain a list of products and my\\nproducts are going to be mentioned in\\nthe form of a map\\nso we are going to have a final list of\\nmap string comma Dynamic why dynamic\\nbecause we also have a price to mention\\nlet me give you an example let's have a\\nfinal products\\nwhich is equal to a list and this list\\nis going to have a map\\nfirst of all there's going to be a title\\nof the product so let's say the title is\\nmen\\nand then I want apostrophe s but if I do\\nthat it will give me an error so I'll\\nput a backslash\\nso it will ignore\\nthis\\nsingle inverted comma\\nand act as if this is a normal single\\ninverted comma all right then yeah men's\\nNike shoes we save it\\nnow you won't be able to see anything on\\nthe screen\\nobviously we have not displayed anything\\nthe next thing we need is a price so\\nwe'll go ahead and set the price let's\\nsay 44.52\\nnow all to all the shoes enthusiasts if\\nthe value is incorrect forgive me for it\\nthen you are going to have sizes this is\\na list of sizes from which the user can\\nselect and this is shown on the product\\ndetails screen so we have 8 comma 5 and\\n9 comma 10 comma 11. so I hope you are\\nunderstanding why this is a list of map\\nstring comma object or dynamic then I\\nwant the image URL and this image URL\\nright now is going to be an asset later\\non it's going to be coming from the web\\nitself because when the user uploads the\\nimage from the device it is going to be\\nstored in the database and then we are\\ngoing to get the URL from the database\\nto display it on the web now if you\\ndon't understand it don't worry don't\\nworry at all just\\nknow that this image URL is the\\nURL we are going to have in the assets\\nso let's go ahead and create an images\\ntab and import all the images now you\\ncan find anything from web\\nwhich is a shoe and you can paste it for\\nyourself but I already have it with me\\nif you want the same images as me you\\ncan find it in the description again\\nbelow\\nAlso let's open this images and\\nfinder let's paste it\\ncome over here we have all the images\\nyou can view it in vs code itself that's\\nnice\\nnow I can go to the pubspect.aml file\\nscroll up we have assets images\\nI can just uncomment everything and\\nmention the path to my images just like\\nwe did for font so I'm going to have\\nassets slash Images slash shoes\\nunderscore one dot PNG and you need to\\ndo that for all them\\nshoes one two three four so let's go\\nahead and type it out\\nnow yeah it depends on you if you want\\nto do it for all the images you can do\\nit one by one or you can just exclude\\neverything and just have assets slash\\nimages\\nslash you need to put this slash here if\\nyou don't put a slash\\nand you put it like this it will think\\nimages is some sort of file\\nand if you put a slash away it will\\nthink Images slash is a folder so we\\nneed to import everything in this folder\\nso if you do this it will import all the\\nimages to your obspect.yaml in your\\nflutter\\nproject\\nnow you can use anything\\ninside of your app now a disadvantage of\\ndoing Images slash\\nis suppose you add some other image\\nwhich is not related to your app but\\njust to test it out let's say I add\\nshoes underscore file and I never use it\\nin my app\\nbut I've still registered it\\nthat will add unnecessary weight or\\nunnecessary\\nsize to my application and we want to\\nreduce it as much as possible so yeah\\nalways try to reduce the application\\nsize\\ngreat now we can close this and we can\\nmention the image URL we have assets\\nslash Images slash shoes\\nunderscore one dot PNG\\nnow you can copy paste this again and\\nagain so that you have appropriate stuff\\nso I'm going to paste it four times now\\nif you don't want to write all of this\\nby yourself\\nwhat you can do instead\\nis check the description of the video\\nthere you'll find a link and you can\\ncopy all of the product data from there\\nwhich is what I'm going to do\\nso I can select everything paste it over\\nhere and I have products I did miss one\\nthing which was or two things ID and\\nCompany\\nso what company is this or what brand is\\nthis shoe off\\nthis will help us to figure out how to\\nfilter things and then an ID for every\\nproduct\\nand then we have the correct image URL\\nfor everything\\nwe also have another thing over here\\nwhich is the cart I hope you copied that\\nas well and that is a dummy data for the\\nstuff to be shown in the cart later on\\nwhen we add State Management it is going\\nto be dynamic but just when we are\\ncreating the UI we want it simple right\\nso we will just have our card as a dummy\\ndata perfect now let's close this go to\\nthe home page\\nand just before the column ends because\\nI still want it in a column right we\\nhave our first element of the column a\\nrow then the second element has a list\\nview Builder and the third element\\nwell what is this going to be\\nthis is going to be a list view Builder\\nas well right\\nthis is going to be a list view Builder\\nbecause\\nI want to build all the products\\nthat I can see products.link and I want\\nto display a product card for it every\\nsingle time I have that\\nso we are going to use a list view\\nBuilder as well so I'll type out list\\nview Builder like this and then we are\\ngoing to get a context index and that's\\nit we also need to specify the item\\ncount we've used lets you Builder quite\\na few times so we know what to use but\\nnow we need access to the global\\nvariable products so we can just type in\\nproducts like this dot length and make\\nsure that you import the global\\nvariables package from Shop app fillet\\nwhich is our own package all right\\nso now we have access to the products\\nand now we can extract one particular\\nproduct using products at particular\\nindex\\nso now we have access to each of the\\nproduct here\\nand now we want to design how the\\nproduct card should look like it should\\nlook like this\\nand I'm not going to go ahead and return\\nlet's say a container over here because\\nthis can get quite big so what I'm going\\nto do is extract this out in a separate\\nwidget of its own and call this product\\nunderscore card dot dot\\nthen I'll import material.dot\\nthen I'm going to have a stateless\\nwidget\\nand I'm going to call this product card\\nall right I'm also going to return a\\ncontainer\\nand let's go ahead and make this card\\nnow here you have two options to use you\\ncan either use a card widget or a\\ncontainer which one will you use here\\nwell you can use both of them and style\\nit according to the way you want but I'm\\ngoing to go ahead with container because\\ncard will give me an elevation it gives\\nme it will give me a shadow effect\\nbehind and I don't want any of that\\neffect I just want a simple\\nbox to be there with color in it so I\\ncan just use a container for that task\\nand then I'm just going to go ahead and\\nput in a child and in the child a column\\nand the column will have children why\\nbecause we have three different things\\nhere we have the title we have the price\\nand then we have the products image URL\\nokay so let's go ahead and do this so\\nthe first thing is the text so we need\\nthe title and the title is going to vary\\nfor everything\\nso we can take it from The Constructor\\njust like we did with the weather app\\nright\\nso we can have\\nfinal string title then we are going to\\nrequire this through the named argument\\nand then I'm going to have title passed\\nit over here\\ngreat also since it is giving us this\\nwarning and I want to get rid of this\\nwarning I'm going to put a color over\\nhere and the color of the container is\\ngoing to be this particular color so\\nwhat is this particular color\\nwell it can be color dot from rgbo\\n216 240\\n253\\ncomma 1 okay so r value is 216 G is 240\\n253 is blue and opacity is one and if I\\nsave this I see nothing because I\\nhaven't returned the product card so\\nlet's go ahead and return it over here\\nI'll return product card and the title\\nis let's say hi okay I'll save it and\\nnothing shows up on the screen why we\\nare expecting a list view Builder right\\nbut if we open the debug console I see\\nthese errors\\nwhy is this error well again the same\\nthing unless you build it wants to take\\nthe entire width or our entire height\\nbut it's not getting the entire height\\nso we need to give it the\\namount of height we want to give it and\\nwhat should the height be here well it\\nshould be the entire remaining screen\\nright we cannot give it like size box\\n400 because then on certain screens it\\nwill only take a level this long and on\\ncertain screens it will take the entire\\nheight so for this reason I am going to\\nwrap it with\\na widget of expanded so it will take the\\nall amount of possible space and here we\\nsee high perfect\\nand we have I guess four products\\nreturned and even in a global variables\\nwe have four products so that means we\\nare doing the correct thing nice\\nnow I'm going to go ahead and put a size\\nbox of height five\\nand after that I'm going to put a price\\nso the price is going to be dollar\\nsomething and that something is going to\\ncome from the Constructor again so I'm\\ngoing to final string or final double\\nprice\\nand then we're going to require this\\nprice so we have required this dot price\\nand then we can have dollar dollar price\\nbut now we have two dollars and it\\nthinks we are using the dollar to\\nhalf string interpolation So to avoid\\nthat we are going to put\\nslash\\nbefore the first dollar sign so it knows\\nthat we are talking about the real\\nactual dollar and then it can use string\\ninterpolation for dollar price\\nperfect\\nnow I can save this much I come away I\\nsee nothing because in the home page I\\nneed to provide a price so the price\\nright now can be a static value of 25.2\\ncome over here and we see dollar 25.2\\nthat's great\\nand the final thing I need is my images\\nto show up so again I'll leave a size\\nbox of height 5. now how do we show\\nimages in flutter apps that's not what\\nwe have seen\\nso to do that we have the image widget\\nright we have this image which you can\\nuse\\nto display stuff\\nand then this requires an image property\\nwhich requires image provider so we can\\npass an image\\nprovider here and you see it's an\\nabstract class so again we need to use a\\nsubtype of image provider and whenever\\nthere is abstract class abstract class\\nis only created in such cases because\\nthere are multiple types you can pass to\\nit for example this image can be from\\nassets what we have mentioned in our app\\nit can be from Network that means it's\\ncoming from the web and you want to\\ndisplay it\\nso there can be multiple types that's\\nwhy the abstract classes are created\\nthat's why we can just search for asset\\nimage\\nand you can pass it over here and this\\nasset image requires an asset name so\\nour asset name is going to come from\\nhere again so you're going to have final\\nstring image\\nrequired\\nthis dot image now I can take this image\\nput it in asset image and we're done\\nnow\\nwe can come here\\npath in an image and for image we'll\\nhave to use this product so we can go\\nahead and use product image URL\\nas string all right we need to use as\\nstring over here because\\nin global variables products is defined\\nas list of map of string comma object it\\nthinks it's an object\\nnot a particular value\\nor not dynamic so that's why we need to\\ntell it that yeah we are sure that this\\nis a string\\nand we can do the same things over here\\nsince we've already done it product\\nprice as double and\\nproduct\\ntitle as string right\\nnow we can come over here and we see our\\nimages are showing up nicely and it is\\nscrollable\\nso that's good now first thing we need\\nto do is make sure the height is\\nconstrained it's not whatever it wants\\nto be so let's go ahead and\\nuse it\\nso an asset image we cannot specify the\\nheight but an image\\nwe do have a property of height so we\\ncan go ahead and pass the height as\\nlet's say 175 if we do that it will only\\ntake as much height as we tell it to all\\nright\\ngreat\\nnow instead of using image like this\\na smaller option can be image dot asset\\nthen you directly mention the asset\\nand you can also specify the height over\\nhere\\nand you're done so this is just a\\nshorter option of doing the same thing\\nyou can use it\\nbecause it's the same image widget that\\nwe are using but now it has\\ndot asset to it attached\\nso it is a Constructor thing and it just\\nsimplifies a task if we want it to and\\nyou'll see no difference over here\\nperfect\\nnow we do have a white patch over here\\nand that white batch is visible over\\nhere as well and that's simply because\\nof the image we've chosen the image is\\nlike this that's why we are getting the\\nwhite patch okay great now that we have\\nimage.asset in place the next thing I\\nwant to do is increase the height of all\\nof these things\\nso I want a particular textile for this\\nthing so what I'm going to do is\\ngeneralize it in main.dot for text theme\\nright so I'll come over here and add\\ntext theme\\nthis allows me to pass in typography\\nor theming of text all right now I can\\npass in the text themes I want to use\\nand I'm doing this because I want to\\nreuse my\\ntitles everywhere I use all right so if\\nI am using a text title over here I want\\nthat particular theme to be used in some\\nother\\ntext theme as well that is why I'm\\nmentioning it over here you'll see it\\nlater on as we reuse these text themes\\nthe main point of me doing all of this\\nand setting up the text theme over here\\nis just reusability\\nI can change the text theme from one\\nparticular place and it will reflect all\\nover the app that's what I want\\nso anyways I'll go ahead and mention\\ntitle medium which is what I'm going to\\nspecify for\\nthis thing over your title medium\\nso the textile here is going to be font\\nweight font weight dot bold because I\\nwant it bolded and the fonts\\nsize I want to use the size so the font\\nsize will be 20. quite small because our\\nmain title this title over here is 35.\\nso I want it smaller than that and much\\nsmaller than that\\nand now if I do that there's no visible\\nchanges over here because this text is\\non its own it doesn't inherit the\\nproperties I've defined over here so I\\nwant to make sure that it inherits those\\nproperties or you know just starts\\ntaking those properties not inherits\\nbut starts taking those properties so I\\nam going to put style and that will be\\ntheme dot off context\\nso you see the context is helping us\\naway a\\nto find the particular widget in the\\nwidget tree that's what we had discussed\\nright context will always help us to\\nlocate a particular widget that's why we\\nare passing the context over here and\\neven if we go to the function definition\\nyou'll find inherited theme is equal to\\ncontext it uses the context to find the\\nparticular inherited widget of that type\\nso it uses context to find another\\nwidget of the same type this is where\\ncontext can help so here I am going to\\ndo theme dot of context dot text theme\\nDot\\nand here what is the style admission\\ntitle medium so I'm going to mention\\ntitle medium here perfect and when I do\\nthat\\nit looks good perfect\\nnow what I want to do is set the style\\nfor this dollar 44.52 as well\\nso let's go ahead and the main.dot file\\nand here I'm going to mention\\neither title small or body small you can\\nuse whatever and please note that these\\nfont sizes like title medium body small\\nthese are used by certain widgets\\nwhen they want to set up text for\\nexample Abba Abba uses one of the\\nproperties from your like title Lodge to\\ndisplay text on the screen\\nso text theme has a bunch of values\\nalready there you can see it over here\\nif we don't don't mention anything\\nthey have a style of their own but if we\\ndo mention it it will override those\\nexisting stuff and app bar like widgets\\nso for example if I put app bar text\\ntext uses this text themes property like\\ntitle Lodge to display stuff on the\\nscreen I'm going to share it to you when\\nwe go to the product details screen\\nyou'll see that okay\\nso we come over here set up body small\\nnow you can set anything but I'm setting\\nit body small because I want\\nthe body to be small everywhere so I can\\nhave textile\\nand font weight can be font weight dot\\nbold again and font size can be 16. so\\nit's smaller than the title medium but\\nit's still small\\nnow I can come over here I'll copy the\\nstyle I'll paste it for the price but\\ninstead of title medium I'm going to\\nhave body small okay now if I come over\\nhere dollar 44.52 this is nice\\nGray\\nso we have all of this set up but still\\nthere are problems\\nif you compare it with your there are\\nmany problems so the first problem I\\nwant to fix\\nis the alignment issue so everything is\\nin the center I want everything to be in\\nthe left hand side\\nso in the column I'm going to set the\\ncross access alignment obviously I want\\nit in the start\\nand it's a column\\nso I'll have cross access alignment dot\\nstart we'll save it and everything\\nshifts over here\\nbut I still want padding to be present\\nso what will I do\\nI'll wrap this column in a padding\\nwidget\\nI hope you're getting the hang of it\\nwhatever you can think of this is what I\\nwant to do you can display it on the\\nscreen\\nso I just thought that I wanted this to\\nbe a little bit away from everything\\nfrom the left from the top so I just use\\nthe padding widget it should come\\nintuitively to you\\nnow instead of all I can have\\nagencies.all 16 and this looks better\\nnow the problem here is the image isn't\\ncentered\\nI want it to be in the center I don't\\nwant it in the left hand side just after\\nthe padding is done no\\nso what I'm going to do here is\\nwrap the image in a center\\nyou can use align property you can use\\nsome other thing you can think of but\\nI'm going to go ahead and Center it and\\nyeah that's easy\\nthe next thing I want to do is make sure\\nthat I leave some space from here you\\nsee\\nthere is space between every card and\\nthere is space\\nfrom the device width as well\\nso again we'll have to use the margin\\nproperty of the container since we are\\nin a container we don't have to wrap\\nanything\\nso I can just do that so I'll have\\nmargin agent sets Dot\\nall 20.\\nalso I can put Constable save it and\\nthere we go perfect\\nnow you might think hey since you\\nalready have a container why are we\\nusing a padding over here why can't we\\njust take this padding and push it over\\nhere and then you can remove the widget\\nyou can remove the widget by doing so\\nsave it and yeah things are still the\\nsame if you thought this way then\\ncongrats you're becoming a better\\nflutter developer\\nyou have your Basics nailed down since\\nwe already have a container there's\\nmargin property and there's also padding\\nand I've already explained the\\ndifference between the margin and\\npadding to you\\nso we don't need the extra padding\\nwidget now if you put it there's no harm\\nbut why do you want multiple widgets\\nwhen one widget can do it for you\\nsweet the next thing I want is\\nthe border to be curved and that should\\nmake my entire app better\\nso how do I make this curved\\ndoes container have a property for that\\nnot really there's no order related\\nproperty\\nbut we do have something known as\\ndecoration\\nand this requires decoration which is\\nagain an abstract class\\nso you can't instantiate it however you\\ncan use box decoration which is\\ngenerally used with flutter\\nso you can use that over here and\\nbox decoration will allow you to pass in\\na color which you've already done but\\nyou'll see why we need a color over here\\nthen we have an image that we can pass\\nin yep we can pass a container image\\nthen border border radius border radius\\nis what we want we want to put that nice\\ncurves\\nso we can put that\\nand now we can have border radius dot\\ncircular 20.\\nagain tried and tested values you can\\njust keep using it and now we see an\\nerror as soon as we provide border\\nradius it is giving me an error why so\\nlet's try to remove water radius and C\\nif I remove water radius I still have\\nthis error\\nso this has something to do with box\\ndecoration if I remove box decoration\\nand save the errors go away now this\\nerror is there because\\nyou have defined a color over here and\\nthen you've also defined decoration\\nnow if decoration is mentioned then you\\nhave to shift the color from outside to\\ninside\\nand then the error goes away however if\\nyou have\\nno box decoration or decoration\\nmentioned you only want a color\\nthen that's fine too but both can't be\\nthere decoration and color in a\\ncontainer cannot be passed the color has\\nto be moved inside the Box decoration\\nfor it to work now you might ask why\\ndoes container have a color property if\\nbox decoration also has a color property\\nand that's because box decoration isn't\\njust used for container it is used for\\nliterally every\\ndecoration property so if some other\\nwidget requires decoration property and\\na decoration class\\nyou can pass box decoration to it and\\nthen you can also specify the color\\nalso since it requires decoration\\nsomething that extends decoration can be\\npath steer so it's not necessarily box\\ndecoration Maybe\\nyou want something else some other\\ndecoration type\\nand you can see that over here some\\nother decoration can be known over here\\nlike shape decoration all right\\nthat's why color was mentioned over here\\nso yeah the point is if color is defined\\nin container you cannot\\nuse decoration and if you want to use\\ndecoration Define both of them inside\\nit's also written in box decoration over\\nhere if you scroll down if color is null\\nthis decoration does not paint the\\nbackground color\\nif image is null this decoration does\\nnot paint a background image and it does\\nso on and on okay\\nso let's restart and we come over here\\nand our app is looking similar not the\\nsame why is it not looking the same\\nwell that's because\\nthe colors are different the first card\\nis this exact color but the second card\\nis a different color\\nand this color if you notice this color\\nis quite similar to this color\\nso we need to use this exact color\\nand we need the background color to\\nchange how should it change well if I\\njust open the app for you\\nthe first one is blue second one is\\nwhite third one is blue again fourth one\\nis white so this is the pattern we want\\nhow can we have this so to generalize on\\neven stuff we want\\nblue color otherwise we want white color\\non even stuff as in the index should be\\neven so this was zero so it was\\nconsidered even\\nso we could mention blue color but as\\nsoon as it became indexed as one it\\nbecame odd that's why it has a\\nbackground color of white\\nso we are going to ask for the product\\ncard color here so we are going to have\\nfinal color background color and this\\nwill be required through the Constructor\\nnow we can take this background color\\npass it to The Container color\\nsave it\\ncome to the home page you have\\nbackground color pass to it then you'll\\nhave product\\nbut product does not have any background\\ncolor how do you how will you make sure\\nthat product has a background color so\\nthis is the reason why\\nwe have to do something like this so we\\nneed to check if index is even\\nso if index is even that means it is 0 2\\n4 6 8 10.\\nthen what do we want to do so if index\\nis even I want to give it a particular\\ncolor if index is odd then I want to\\ngive it the white color so that's what I\\nwant to do\\nso I can just have if index is even then\\nI'm going to have constant color dot\\nfrom rgbo\\nthen I'm going to have 216 240 253 1.\\notherwise index is not even then I'm\\ngoing to have constant color dot from\\nRGB again but this will be 245 247 249.\\n1 what we've used before all right\\nthis is the same color we use for the\\nchip earlier you can see it over here\\nso anyways we have this setup and now\\nyou can see the clear difference now our\\napp is looking much better perfect\\nso this looks great\\nthe next thing we need is this Bottom\\nbar and we can add that later on but\\nfirst what I want to focus on is\\nwhenever I click on this product the\\nproduct Details page should appear\\nso to show you a real demo if I select\\nthis one I click over here the title\\nappears the image appears then\\nsome different colored\\nbox appears with the price the available\\nsizes and the add to cart button\\nso I want to design this so let's go\\nahead and design it so we are going to\\ngo ahead in the lip folder and create\\nproduct underscore details underscore\\npage dot dot\\nnow I'm going to right click over here\\nand close others so it will close all\\nthe other files over here so I have only\\none file to focus on then I'll import\\nmaterial.dot again\\nthen I will create a state less switcher\\nand I'm going to call this product\\ndetails\\npage\\nthen again we are going to return a\\nscaffold and now I want to test how this\\nlooks all right so how can I test it\\nwell for that I can just take this\\nproduct details I can go to the main Dot\\nand replace home page with product\\nDetails page to see the thing right\\nso yeah we do see an empty screen\\nalso it is continuously showing\\nperforming hot reload for iPhone so I'm\\njust going to exit that process and I'm\\ngoing to select iOS here again\\nand then going to run it so that should\\nhopefully work and while that is\\nhappening let's go ahead and design the\\nproduct Details page so the first thing\\nwe need is an app bar which just says\\ndetails\\nso we are going to go and have an app\\nbar title constant text which says\\ndetails\\nsave it and we see details over here\\nwith the yellow background\\nand that yellow background is there\\nbecause we have set primary color to\\nthis yellow color\\nSo to avoid that yellow color what I can\\ndo is go to the main dot dot and you\\nhave set up the global theme for my app\\nbar my app bar should look the same on\\nevery screen so I'm going to set up the\\napp bar theme over here which I can\\nobviously change from here as well but\\nI'm going to do it here because I want\\nit for every app bar so I'm going to\\nhave an ABBA theme which is going to\\nhave first of all a title textile so the\\ntextile is going to be\\nfont size 20 so I wanted a little bit\\nbigger and the color should be colors\\ndot black\\nokay because this is white as of now\\nand doing this much the color\\nchanges the next thing I want is it for\\nit to be transparent\\nand in my opinion it is not transparent\\nbecause we have not said use material 3\\nto true so we want to make sure that it\\nis set to true and you see everything\\nchanges\\nalso if we come back to the home page\\nover here let's put home as home page\\nand we come here nothing really changes\\nover here things are still the same\\nwhat has changed is the app bar is now\\nso first of all let's just change it\\nagain product Details page app bar is\\nnow white in color perfect\\nthen we want the title men's Nike shoes\\nor whatever so for that we'll have to\\nget access to the product so we are\\ngoing to take it from The Constructor\\nand have final string object which is\\nproduct\\nand then I'm going to require it through\\nthe Constructor so I've required this\\ndot product\\nthen I'm going to have a body\\nthe body is going to have a column\\ncolumn is going to have children and the\\nfirst child is going to be text which\\nsays product\\nat particular title which is going to be\\ntreated as a string\\ncool now if we come to the mean dot dot\\nyou see we have to pass in a Constructor\\nhere and the Constructor is a product so\\nlet's go ahead and pass in we are going\\nto import products from the\\nGlobal variables.dot file and then I'm\\ngoing to access the zeroth element now\\nit says invalid constant value because\\nthis isn't a constant\\nthis is a global variable that can\\nchange so we can have a constant remove\\nand there we go\\nso we have men's Nike shoes written over\\nhere now\\ndon't be concerned about products at\\nzero\\nwe're just passing product Details page\\naware so that we can take a look at how\\nto design the page and after that I'll\\ntell you how to navigate from one page\\nto another okay so let's go to the\\nproduct Details page here\\nnow what I want to do is set the style\\nfor this men's Nike shoes thing\\nand if you notice that this\\nfont size and this font style the font\\nweight and the font size both are very\\nsimilar to what we had in the shoes\\ncollection\\nboth are of equal height both have the\\nequal font weight so both of them are\\nquite the same so\\nwhat I'm going to do and what's going on\\nin my mind is what if I go in the home\\npage I copy this textile\\nI go to the main dot dot\\nand then I'm going to have a title Lodge\\nand I'm going to paste this as a textile\\nso the font weight is bold the font size\\nis 35\\nnow I can come to the home page and I'm\\ngoing to have theme dot of context dot\\ntext theme\\nDot\\ntitle large\\nso with this I'll have to remove\\nconstant I'll have to set constant for\\nthis part for this part but the text\\nstyle is no longer constant because it\\nis theme dot off context\\ngreat now why have I done this I've\\nmoved this to the global theme and set\\nit to title lodge because\\nthat's what I want for title Lodge and\\nnow I can reuse this component easily by\\njust copying this thing\\nso this textile can be applied to any\\ntext I want to apply it to this text\\nI'll just pass in the style as this\\nthing over here\\nsave it and there we go men's Nike shoes\\nshows up and it's looking really good\\nthe next thing I want is the image but\\nbefore that I want spacing to be present\\nand the thing about spacing and the\\ntricky part about spacing is this if I\\ncome back to the normal app\\nif I have this kind of thing the spacing\\nshould decrease\\nbut\\nif I have this kind of shoe the spacing\\nshould increase so it's relative spacing\\nright I can't give a fixed value over\\nhere otherwise I'll get render flow\\nerror because this shoe is quite big\\nso if I put let's say a size box of\\nheight 50 and your I put a size box of\\nheight 50 again that will work but if I\\nput a size box of height 50 over here\\nthis shoe will go on the top\\nthen I'll have size box of height 50\\nagain and this container will come right\\nover there so it's not consistent UI\\nbasically and our spacing wire requires\\nrelative spacing so for that particular\\nreason there's another widget that will\\nhelp us to space stuff out and that is\\nthe spacer widget\\nso if I pass constant spacer like this\\nthe spacer requires something known as a\\nflex\\nso anytime you use spacer it will create\\na flex of one on your screen and it will\\nrelatively lay it out\\nso to show it in a diagram form let's\\nsay this is my screen\\nlet's say I have\\nmy text widget over here then I want to\\nleave some space so I can just leave\\nsome space here this will create a flex\\nof one then I have suppose my image so\\nmy image is showing up like this then\\nI'll again have\\na spacer so spacer will be like this\\nthis will also create a flex of one and\\nthis will be relative positioning\\nmeaning\\nthe spacing will be carried out like\\nthis by performing a calculation that\\nthere are total flexes on the screen is\\nequal to 2.\\nso each Flex is going to take a size of\\n1 by 2 on the entire screen\\nsince the number of flexes on the screen\\nis 2\\nthis space is going to be 1 by 2 and\\nthis space is going to be 1 by 2. so\\nthey equally divide themselves if I add\\none more let's say\\nFlex let's add one more Flex over here\\nthe total Flex will be\\n3 and each Flex will take 1 by 3. now a\\nweird thought comes in what if I want\\none of my spacing to take double the\\nspace of another\\nwhat if I don't want second space\\nand this Flex should be bigger all right\\nit should be twice the height\\nof how much this Flex is taking\\nso what will happen I can specify a flex\\nproperty to it you see we have Flex\\nso this can be flexors too this will be\\nFlex as one so the total Flex is 3 but\\nthis will take one third of the\\navailable space and this will take two\\nthird of the available space\\nthat's how flexes work if you don't\\nunderstand this I'm going to demonstrate\\na practical example to you but that was\\njust a diagram so now I've created a\\nflex of one\\nnow I'm going to use image.assic to\\ndisplay my image again and that will be\\nproduct\\nat image URL\\nand we are going to take this as a\\nstring\\nsave it and we come over here\\nour image is showing up and this is the\\nprevious app\\nwe'll get to this app and our image is\\nshowing right at the bottom not bad\\nbecause what has happened over here is\\nthe total Flex is one\\nsince the total Flex over here is 1\\nit says hey I'll take one out of one\\nspace so it takes all the available\\nspace however if I add another spacer\\nwhat happens is\\nthere are two flexors on the screen this\\nthing right here and this thing right\\nhere so this takes one by two\\nand this also takes one by two\\nso both of them take 50 50 of the\\navailable screen space but that is not\\ncool\\nbecause it's simple this should be one\\nthis should be two because this image\\nshould go more up\\nso your will pass and flex as to save it\\ncome over here this looks good enough\\nthe next thing I want to do is wrap this\\nimage with a padding\\nso I can do that I can wrap this with a\\npadding widget\\nand then I'm going to have Edge and says\\ndot all 16.\\nand this looks better\\nI'm not going to specify any height\\nwidth Etc\\nafter this what I want is a container if\\nyou can see over here\\nWhat's Happening Here is there's a\\ncontainer which has its own background\\ncolor you can see it over here then it\\nhas its own text with the price then the\\navailable spy sizes you can select from\\nand then an add to card button so we\\nneed these three components in this\\ncolor\\nso what will you use here and how will\\nyou lay it out well we can use it in a\\ncolumn first of all that's a good thing\\nto clear off so let's go ahead and\\ncreate a container down below so we're\\ngoing to have container\\ndecoration box decoration\\nthen I'll mention a color so the color\\nis going to be constant\\ncolor dot from rgbo and it's going to be\\nthe same color that we had used earlier\\nfor the chip for the second box that was\\nodd\\nI mean the box that had even\\nor odd index\\nso we're going to have 245\\n247\\n249 and 1.\\nafter mentioning the color what I'm\\ngoing to do is\\nmention the width as well so the width\\nover here let's say is 250 I'll save it\\nand I see nothing on the screen why\\nbecause I mentioned the width the\\ncontainers with doesn't really matter\\nhere the height matters because the\\ncontainer is getting the maximum width\\nbecause column is taking the maximum\\nwidth now because it is in the\\nscaffold's body\\nso I can set the height as 250\\nand you see a container has risen above\\nwhere and that looks solid perfect\\nthen I want to make this curved if you\\nsee over here this is also curved so I\\nwant this container to be curved as well\\nso that's why I had set up box\\ndecoration\\nso I can use your border radius and the\\nBorder radius will be border radius dot\\ncircular 20 let's say\\ncome over here\\nand it's hard to see but the Border\\nradius isn't quite enough\\nso I'll set it to 40.\\nand I think this is quite like it so I\\nlike it this way that's good now after\\nthe containers decoration has been done\\nwe can go to the child again column\\nI hope you're becoming experts in UI it\\nis so intuitive in my opinion you know I\\nwant everything vertically I can use a\\ncolumn if I want everything horizontally\\nI can use a row if I want to put items\\nin a list I can use a list view Builder\\nif I want to display a text I can use\\ntext for an image image.asset so I hope\\nyour understanding and getting the hang\\nof things\\nthen I'm going to mention texture and\\nthe text is going to be well slash\\ndollar dollar\\nthen I'll have to mention product\\nprice\\nlike this\\ncool so we have dollar 44.52 showing up\\nbut this now takes only this much space\\nI want to take the entire width so for\\nthat particular reason I can have double\\ndot infinity or even if you don't\\nmention the width it's fine because we\\nhave a list of sizes to display\\nwhen we have a list of dial sizes to\\ndisplay we will be using list view\\nBuilder because\\nwe don't know how many items we are\\ngoing to have it's not one particular\\nvalue\\nit can be 9 10 11 12 for one product it\\ncan be eight nine ten for one product it\\ncan be six nine twelve for one product\\nso the sizes can vary and number of\\nitems can vary that's why I'm using a\\nlist view Builder\\nwhen the number of items is not known\\nyou can use list view Builder when the\\nnumber of items are known then you might\\nwant to use list view we have not taken\\na look at list view but let's do the\\nsame as listview Builder instead of\\npassing an item count item Builder you\\njust have to pass in children just like\\na column and just mention stuff in it\\nso anyways we have product price\\nwhat I want to do is\\nmake sure this text is big enough and if\\nyou notice this text is as big enough as\\nthis one\\nso we're just going to have a style of\\ntheme dot of context Dot\\ntext theme\\nDot\\ntitle launch\\nif I save this dollar 44.52 shows up\\nand now\\nin my column the next thing I'll do is\\nleave a height I'm not using spacer over\\nhere notice that I'm using a size box\\nbecause this isn't relative height\\nit doesn't really matter if my height is\\nrelatively spaced or not in terms of\\nimages it did matter because I wanted\\nconsistent UI\\nso anyways we have a size box here that\\nlooks good\\nso we'll have a height of 10.\\nand after that we are going to have a\\nlist view Builder that will tell us all\\nthe available sizes\\nso we are going to have listview Builder\\nwith an item Builder context and index\\nthen you are going to have item count\\nand the item count is going to be\\nproduct sizes dot length\\nnow if we go to Global variables product\\nsizes so we are doing the correct thing\\nbut we are calling dot length property\\non an object so obviously we need to\\ntreat this as\\na list of double but if we use it as\\nlist of double then it will give us an\\nerror like this why because you're\\nseeing list of double dot length you're\\nnot saying product sizes as list double\\ndot length Okay so you need to wrap it\\nwith the apparent thesis and then you're\\ndone okay\\nnow you can extract one particular size\\nso you have final size which is equal to\\nproduct\\nat sizes\\nat particular index\\nand here it's saying you cannot\\ninvoke\\nthis thing this index unconditionally\\nbecause it thinks that product sizes can\\nbe an object which is nullable so what\\nI'm going to do here is\\ntell them that yeah this can never be\\nnull and then access the index property\\non it but then also I cannot access\\nindex property because there's nothing\\nlike add index on an object\\nso we need to again treat this as\\nsomething so we're going to have as\\ndouble\\nthen\\nI'm going to take this as a whole\\nalso this will be list of double and\\nthen you'll have access to index so what\\nI've done here is the same thing product\\nat sizes as list double and then I'm\\ncalling at index to get one particular\\nsize and now I want to return it so I'm\\ngoing to return chip\\nand then the label which will be text\\nsize dot to string perfect\\nnow we'll save this become aware and we\\nget an error the error is there because\\nit is saying that list of integer is not\\na subtype of list of double so it\\nconsiders these sizes to be all integer\\nand that is true as of now everything is\\ninteger but so let's go ahead and use\\nthat particular thing so we are going to\\nhave as list of integer list of integer\\nsince everything over here size is 9 10\\n12 9 10 12 it cannot have a decimal\\nvalue right that's why it is an integer\\nnow you can just have list of end\\nand you see\\nour UI is not distorted the error goes\\naway but it is all distorted and it's\\nagain thanks to the list view Builder\\nagain list view Builder wants to take\\nthe entire screen size it's not getting\\nthat so it's just distorting our UI and\\ngiving us a bunch of Errors again wrap\\nthis in either expanded or\\nsized box I'm going to wrap it in size\\nbox why\\nvery simple\\nsize box will give at a particular\\nheight of 50\\nso it is constraints\\nin that particular height all right\\nand it can't grow bigger than that\\nAlso let's set the scroll direction as\\naccess dot horizontal and everything is\\nand horizontal Direction\\nafter that I'm just going to wrap my\\nchip widget with padding widget and I'm\\ngoing to have Edge and such dot all 8\\nand everything is evenly spaced out that\\nlooks cool\\nafter this we finally need add to cart\\nbutton and we are done\\nalso I think this dollar 44.52 is right\\nup we have to center it but we can do\\nthat after we add a button so again\\nlet's go ahead and leave a size box of\\nheight 10\\nthen I'm going to have elevated button\\nvery simple I'm not going to use text\\nbutton and the child is going to be\\ntext which says add to cart\\nsave it also we are going to put\\nconstant come aware we have add to cart\\nbutton but now we need to style it first\\nwe need a background color then we need\\nto set the size for it and after that we\\nmight have to change the color of the\\ntext because the color of the text\\ninside of it is yellow we want to change\\nit to Black\\nso let's go ahead we are going to have\\nstyle which will be elevated button dot\\nstyle from\\nthen we want to set the background color\\nwe've already taken a look at the button\\nso much it's just\\na revisit for you I hope\\nso now the background color should be\\nyellow and it's yellow because the\\noverall theme of my app is yellow so now\\nI just want to set it to theme dot off\\ncontext dot color scheme dot primary\\ncolor\\nso with this it has a primary color of\\nwhat we have defined yellow now I want\\nthe minimum size to be there\\nthe minimum size of this button should\\nbe this much and otherwise it can take\\nwhatever it wants so it will be double\\ndot infinity and height will be 50.\\nthen we can save it come over here\\nand here is a button add to cart button\\nhas disappeared and that's because that\\nwas already yellow so let's change it\\nback to black so we are going to set the\\nstyle over here which will be textile\\ncolor will be colors dot black\\nand\\nfont size will be 18. let's just make\\nthe font size a little bit bigger this\\nlooks good\\nnow we need some spacing from here right\\nso obviously\\nwe need padding I hope that stuck your\\nmind you know this is a way to know that\\nyou're progressing\\nthen you have agencies.all let's say 10\\nnot enough let's try 20\\ngood enough\\nbut the width or the height between both\\nof them has increased and it has\\nincreased because we have a size box of\\nheight 10 over here then we have\\nagencies.all 20 so that means the\\nspacing from here till here is 20 plus\\n10 which is 30.\\nand from all the other sides it's 20.\\nthat's why what I'm going to do is\\nremove the size box height so from all\\nthe places it is 20 and it looks better\\nand final thing for the UI here is\\nI want everything to be in the center so\\nI'll just access the main column and set\\nit to main access alignment Dot Center\\nand there we go this looks awesome\\nthe next thing in this screen what I\\nwant to do is whenever I select a\\nproduct I can select a size for it and\\nwe've already done this with the chip\\nwidget\\nthe same thing I want to do over here as\\nwell with the sizing\\nso I recommend you to try this on your\\nown and make sure that your logic is\\ncorrect and what you're doing is correct\\nso that you have more confidence in\\nyourself\\nso pause the video and try it for\\nyourself\\nI hope you were able to do it for\\nyourself now let's try it together\\nwhat I'm going to do first of all is\\nconvert the stateless to a stateful\\nwidget then I'm going to have\\nend selected size is equal to\\n0 let's say so the selected size is 0 at\\nfirst\\nthen I take the selected size\\nso I have in selected size equal to 0\\nthen I'll scroll down\\nhere where did it go the chip yep yeah\\nI'm going to have a background color of\\nselected size is equal equal to size so\\nif it really does match my size then I'm\\ngoing to select one thing\\nso let's say\\nif it is selected then the color is\\ntheme dot off context dot color scheme\\ndot primary color\\notherwise it is all going to be null\\nokay\\nthat's nice if the background color is\\nnull that means it takes the default\\ncolor that is already given to it\\nand we get this kind of error now so\\nlet's just restart and there we go there\\nare is fixed to fix it on Android\\nemulator we'll click over here restart\\nand it will start\\nokay cool now if I select anything still\\nnothing happens because we have not\\nupdated the value of selected size so\\nwhat we need to do is wrap the chip\\nwidget with a gesture detector we are\\nnot going to wrap the padding widget\\nwith gesture detector and I've already\\nmentioned the reason to you\\nnow uh in the on top I'm going to have\\nset State don't forget that and selected\\nsize should be equal to size\\nthe size we have extracted over here\\nand now if I select anything it is\\nselected perfect\\nnow what I want to do is come back to\\nthe main dot dot I'll\\nmention home page over here\\nand this should be a constant I'll come\\nat the top and remove product details\\nand Global variables from here\\nnow what I want to do actually is\\nwhenever the user clicks on one\\nparticular product I want to navigate\\nthem from one screen to another how will\\nI do that well that opens up to a New\\nConcept and flutter which is Navigator\\nlet's talk about it and how it works so\\nlet's dive in the code for it we are\\ngoing to close all the files here and\\nI'm going to go to one particular page\\nwhich is the home page where I have just\\none thing\\nif I scroll down the product card\\nso I want the product card to be wrapped\\nwith the gesture detector and whenever I\\nclick on that product card\\nI want to get navigated from one screen\\nto another\\nso first of all let's go ahead and wrap\\nit with gesture detector\\nthen we are going to have on tap you see\\nthere are lots of options gesture\\ndetector provides as well but we're\\ngoing to go ahead with on tap and then\\non tap what do we want to do well we\\nwant to navigate from home page to\\nproduct Details page now since we have\\nthat much Clarity it's easier for us why\\nwe just have to do Navigator dot off\\nagain or Navigator dot off also uses\\ninherited widget behind the scenes and\\ncontext is used to find ancestor State\\nancestor State again\\nso context is helping us find the\\nnearest Navigator\\nand using that Navigator\\nI can navigate from one page to another\\nthen after doing Navigator dot off I get\\na bunch of properties over here Focus\\nnode overlay but that's not what I'm\\ninterested in what I'm interested in is\\nmethods like pop push\\npop and push name so let's go over them\\none by one so first one is pop pop is\\nbasically popping off the screen\\nnow to understand this you'll have to\\nunderstand how Navigator really works\\nlet's remove this diagram and draw a\\ndiagram for navigator\\nthink of Navigator as a stack all right\\nwhat is the stack well let's just think\\nof it as\\na pile of books on a desk all right so\\nlet's just consider this is a desk\\nand then you have a bunch of books on\\ntop of it so there is one book\\nall right then there is another book on\\ntop of it\\nand then another book on top of it okay\\nthis is how Navigator works it works on\\nthe concept of Stack this is a stack\\nanything that's above one another is a\\nstack\\nand just\\nas a general information stack is also a\\nwidget in flutter that will help you to\\nbuild uis so it has children pass to it\\nso you can pass one particular widget\\nwhich will be the background and after\\nthat\\nthe next widget you pass in will be\\nabove it so if you have text hi then you\\nhave text\\nhello\\nthat will just make sure that there is\\nkind of this thing so let's just have\\nthis CC\\nhi\\nis there you won't be able to see it but\\nyou see H is kind of\\nbolded that's because\\nhi and hello are there so H is\\noverlapping\\nso basically high is below hello\\nso it is stacking up so in this case\\nhigh is this thing hello is this thing\\nand the eyes are over here this is your\\neyes right if these are your eyes\\nand you're looking from your to bottom\\nwhat will you see you'll first see Hello\\nthen you'll see hi right and that's why\\nso this is the general concept of stack\\nstack is also a data structure\\nso basically this is the concept on\\nwhich Navigator works whenever you call\\nthings like pop\\nit just pops off and removes off the\\ntopmost screen it will just pop off and\\nremove off the topmost screen well how\\ndo you add screens on the top that would\\nbe the biggest question\\nwell for that\\nyou use Navigator dot off context dot\\npush so what push does is it has one\\nwidget it will just stack it above\\nanother again you push something from\\nOne widget to another it will just put\\nit on top of another widget so this is\\nour push works and pop just removes of a\\nparticular widget\\njust think in terms of our array right\\nit also works on the concept of Stack\\nright if you use two\\nand then you use add function to add the\\nnumber three it will add it to the last\\nthen you use push to add four so you\\nwill be adding 4 to our array and then\\nwhen you want to remove something or pop\\nsomething\\nit will remove it from the last unless\\nyou specify what kind of\\npage you want to or what kind of number\\nyou want to remove so it's kind of like\\na list but in general it is called stack\\nokay so now I want to call Push because\\nI want to push it now here's another\\nimportant concept which is of this thing\\npush\\nreplacement\\nso what push replacement does is if you\\ncall navigator.off context dot push\\nreplacement from this screen\\nit will replace this entire screen with\\na different screen altogether so this is\\nout of the picture now now if you call\\nPop after that it will pop this screen\\nand will give you the screen back\\nso replace push replacement just\\nreplaces the entire thing entirely it\\njust removes it from the stack\\nwith itself\\nand then when you call pop it will just\\npop this thing\\nso I hope you understood that\\nnow we have Push replacement here not\\npush replacement I want Push and what\\npush requires here is something known as\\nroute\\nand generally what we pass over here is\\nmaterial page route\\nor a Cupertino page route\\nor something that basically extends mati\\nuh just a page route all right so you\\nhave page route Builder that you can\\npass away or anything that has or\\nextends page routing why do we have to\\ndo this well it's boilerplate code but\\nwe have to do material page route\\nbecause what you're doing is\\ntrying to add a platform adaptive\\ntransition here\\nso moving from one screen to another\\nlooks different on different devices\\nand those are transitions the way they\\ndo it on iOS it might be different from\\nfor iOS it might be different that's why\\nso you need to mention material page\\nrouting and here you can mention more\\nsettings but I hardly ever use any of\\nthem\\nthen it requires Builder\\nthat requires a context or that gives\\nthe context which you can use\\nso we have this and here what do we have\\nto pass well we have to return a widget\\nfrom here what Widget the widget you\\nwant to transition to you want to move\\nto so I want to move to the product\\ndetails screen so I'm going to return it\\nfrom here\\nand I'm also going to pass in the\\nproduct that I have extracted here\\nperfect now if I save it I'll restart my\\napp\\nand when I click over here I go to the\\nparticular product if I click over here\\nI go to Adidas shoes\\nif I click over here I go to Bata\\nwomen's shoes now I know the images are\\nincorrect but forgive me for that this\\nis just about learning\\nall the images and illustrations used\\nhere are incorrect I know\\nso we can close this and yeah this works\\nwell\\nnow just to demonstrate what I was\\ntalking if I use replace surveyor\\nnot replace push replacement\\nthen what will happen is when I click\\nover here I won't be able to go back\\nwhen I try to go back I won't be able to\\non Android emulator to go back I have to\\nclick this when I try to do that I won't\\nbe able to do obviously\\nonly when I\\nclick over here\\nwhen I try to go back I just exit the\\napp\\nagain when I try to open the app you\\nknow I just go back that is how\\nreplacement works I won't be able to go\\nback from the screen\\nso obviously push replacement is needed\\nand stuff like let's say Authentication\\nso when you have logged in you don't\\nwant the user to go back to the login\\nscreen that's why\\nyou use push replacement that time not\\npush but in scenarios like this push is\\nvery much needed and you also notice the\\ndifference over here all right let's\\nhave iPhone simulator hot restart when I\\nclick over here and when there's push I\\nget the back button however when the\\npush button is not there\\nit's push replacement then I don't get\\nany back button\\nso I hope that was clear and I hope you\\nunderstand what the code for navigator\\nis it's Navigator dot off context then\\nyou either want to push push replacement\\npop and there are a bunch of other\\nthings like push and remove until\\nthere's push named which is related to\\nnamed routes but we'll get to it when we\\nstart building stuff for the entire web\\nall right\\nwhen we make our layout\\ngood enough for all the screen sizes so\\nwe have push here then we have Push\\npop and push restorable push all of that\\nstuff but the most commonly used is push\\npush replacement and Pop I don't think\\nyou're going to need anything other than\\nthose 90 of the times obviously so now\\nthat we have understood this I just want\\nto clear how Navigator works\\nso in flutter the Navigator is actually\\nresponsible for managing the navigation\\nstack and handling the transitions\\nbetween different screens or routes in\\nan application\\nwe passed in a material page route and\\nthat handles the navigation you see when\\nI click over here I get a transition\\nwhich goes from right to left but on\\nAndroid it goes from bottom to top\\nyou see\\nnot even bottom to top it's kind of like\\na fade animation\\nso it is platform adaptive based on what\\nplatform it is on it will perform that\\nnavigation or that transition\\nand whenever we call Navigator dot off\\ncontext we're basically using inherited\\nwidget it Returns the nearest Navigator\\nwidget\\nin the widget tree that contains the\\nbuild context\\nexactly like theme Right In theme also\\nit would go up the widget tree finding\\ntheme class and it would inherit or take\\nproperties from it same thing is\\nhappening for navigator it is going up\\nthe widget tree trying to find Navigator\\nnow you might say hey everyone we have\\nnever\\ncreated any Navigator stuff over here\\nand that's true you've never done it but\\nmaterial app has\\nmaterial app behind the scenes creates a\\nnavigator class which you can find when\\nyou just try to look over here all right\\nyou'll be able to find stuff\\nso material app does it for you\\nnow behind the scenes Navigator\\nmaintains a stack of Route objects which\\nI told you about which represent the\\ndifferent screens or routes in your\\napplication I'm saying different screens\\nor routes because sometimes you might\\nnot want to return a screen when you go\\nto a particular or when you use\\nNavigator what you want to show is let's\\nsay a half screen dialog\\nsomething like an alert dialog box\\nsomething like that so even then\\nNavigator can help you and those\\nsettings over here which are present for\\nnavigator\\nin the material page route can help you\\nlike full screen dialogue maintain State\\nall of that\\nso those are different routes but\\nusually you'll be encountering different\\nscreens because to create a dialogue a\\npop-up you have several other things\\nnow when you navigate to a new screen\\nyou push a new route onto the stack so\\nif you want one particular screen so\\nlet's say I have my home page over here\\nthat's the home screen now I want to\\npass product details so I'm going to\\npass it at the top over here\\nso I push it on top of the stack and\\nthis is what happens when you navigate\\nback for example when I click over here\\nand when I go back when I click on this\\nback button\\nnavigator.op is called all right and\\nthen you navigate back\\nfrom year to year so behind the scenes\\nnavigator.off context Dot\\npop is called so it goes back to\\nwhatever screen it came from\\nso just to summarize if you've\\nunderstood you can skip this part\\nwhenever you call Navigator dot off\\ncontext it looks for the nearest\\nNavigator widget in the given tree\\nand this is typically provided by\\nmaterial or Cupertino app right at the\\ntop of the widget a hierarchy\\na root widget once it finds a navigator\\nwidget it returns an instance of the\\nNavigator state\\nnow this Navigator state is the thing\\nthat allows us to manipulate the\\nnavigation stack so if you go to\\nnavigator.off context you'll see static\\nNavigator state so this Navigator state\\nis the thing\\nthat does most of our work\\nand it allows us to manipulate the\\nnavigation stack so with the navigate a\\nstate object now you can perform various\\nnavigation operations like we saw\\nwhenever we call Navigator dot off\\ncontext it gives us the Navigator State\\nnow with this Navigator State we can\\ncall push pop\\npush replacement\\nall of those stuff when you push a new\\nroute\\nthe Navigator animates or transitions\\nfrom the previous route to the new route\\nusing transition animation which are\\nalready predefined for platforms on\\nAndroid it is like\\na fade in transition and for iOS it is a\\nsliding transition\\ntransitions are there so that it\\nprovides a smooth visual effect it\\ndoesn't go like hey you suddenly change\\nthe screen and you get to know that\\nthese are two different screens\\nit just is a smooth process and when you\\npop her out from the stack the Navigator\\nreverses the animation bringing back the\\nprevious route so when you click over\\nhere you see we have\\nright to left and when we click back it\\nis left to right so it just reverses the\\ntransition\\nso I hope you understood how Navigator\\nworks and this is how anything that has\\ndot off context will work\\nbecause they are using inherited widget\\nand that is the biggest concept\\nin State Management once you understand\\nthat you'll be understanding\\nNavigator\\nscaffold messenger that we'll take a\\nlook at\\nand many State Management tools as well\\nand I hope you're also understanding the\\nimportance of build context\\nBill context is making sure behind the\\nscenes that you can find the correct\\nNavigator State widget\\nbecause just think about it even in the\\nflutter source code the flutter source\\ncode is so big and if you want to access\\nfrom One widget to another there might\\nbe some way of communication right you\\ncan't just keep going through the\\nConstructor and keep passing everything\\nfor stuff like these product Details\\npage Constructor is fine\\nbecause it's just one product that you\\nwant to display and storing it in a\\nstate management tool is just stupid\\nhowever\\nin stuff like add to cart\\nusing State Management is required for\\nexample if I have a bottom navigation\\nbarrier\\nand when I click over there\\nI should see the card page so that means\\nI go to the product Details page\\nI click on add to cart and it should add\\nit to my cart page\\nthink of it in form of a widget tree if\\nit's hard to visualize just draw it out\\nand see or I can do it for you you have\\nyour root widget\\nthen you have your material app\\nthen after the material app you have the\\nhome page\\nthen after the home page there's another\\nwidget you could take which is the cart\\npage right home page and card page are\\nshown differently as of now\\nso if you click one item like the cart\\nbutton\\nin the bottom bar\\nfor example\\nover here\\nwhen you click the cart item you should\\nbe seeing card products so there are two\\noptions you can take now in the home\\npage if you click on something you can\\ngo to the product Details page\\nnow my card\\nor my add to cart button is mentioned\\ninside of this particular widget which\\nis the product Details page so what I\\nwant to do is whatever I click over here\\nshould be added to a list\\nand that list should be accessible in a\\nseparate widget as well how do we do\\nthat\\nhow can I make sure that stuff passes\\nfrom Child widget to parent widget from\\nparent widget to its parent widget and\\nthen it can pass it to its sibling\\nthis is quite a cumbersome process you\\ncan do it in flutter but it's quite\\ncumbersome so instead of doing that what\\nI'm going to do is introduce State\\nManagement which usually does something\\nlike this\\nyou shift everything down then the State\\nManagement tool will create\\na storehouse for itself right at the top\\nof the widget tree and here\\nyou store all the data\\nand this is what state management is you\\nstore all the data over here\\nso what you do is\\nadd to cart from your to your the\\nchanges are made over here and then you\\ncontinuously listen\\nfrom the card screen to this particular\\nscreen\\nor this particular storehouse\\nso just to summarize if you didn't\\nunderstand whenever I click on add to\\ncart button in my app over here it\\nshould be displayed over here so what\\nI'm going to do is whenever add to cart\\nbutton is clicked on I'm going to update\\nand store all the data in one particular\\nState Management tool which will be the\\nhead of everything\\nand whenever I want to read data I'm\\ngoing to read everything from this State\\nManagement tool or the storehouse itself\\nso if I make changes over here\\nI can read it instantly\\nif I make deletions updating any stuff\\nit will automatically be received over\\nhere this particular tool will do that\\nso this is what we are going to do in\\nState Management I hope you understood\\nthe concept\\nbecause\\nI'm not going to explain it again I've\\nalready explained that now we'll see it\\nin the form of code but before that we\\nstill have to get done with the UI and\\nwhat I want to create is a bottom bar\\nwire\\nwhich tells you hey do you want to\\naccess cart you can access card from\\nhere so let's go ahead and do that so\\nlet's go ahead and add bottom navigation\\nbar to both of these things\\nso let's just close all the save files\\nfrom here go to the\\nhome page\\nand here we are going to set up our\\nbottom navigation bar because whenever\\nwe return a scaffold we get body we get\\nthe Abba property and we also get a\\nfooter kind of thing which is the bottom\\nnavigation bar this bottom navigation\\nbar accepts a widget so you can pass\\nanything over here but there is a\\nspecial widget for bottom navigation bar\\nwhich is bottom navigation bar itself\\nhere there's a required argument of\\nitems that you need to pass in and it\\nshould be a list of bottom navigation\\nbar item so we're going to copy this put\\nit in the list\\nand then we're going to use that so\\nwe're going to have bottom navigation\\nbar item\\nand here we're going to have pass in an\\nicon\\nand that's pretty much all there there\\nis\\nso the item we want over here or the\\nicon we want at first is icons dot home\\nso I want the home icon to be there\\nand the second item that I require is\\nbottom navigation bar item which is\\nshopping bag or shopping cart whatever\\nyou want to use I'll go ahead and use\\nshopping cart\\nthen you can save it also put a\\nconstable here because both of these\\nitems are constant so the list becomes a\\nconstant\\nand when you come over here you still\\nsee this error and this error is\\nbasically saying that item.label is not\\nequal to null so that means the label\\nproperty should be added somewhere where\\nin bottom navigation bar item even\\nthough this is nullable it does require\\na label to be passed in but what if I\\ndon't want to pass any label it should\\nbe nothing so I'll just pass in an empty\\nlabel here\\nin both of these things and the error\\ngoes away I see my bottom navigation bar\\ngreat\\nnow what I want to do is whenever I\\nclick any of them\\nI want to navigate to that particular\\nscreen\\nso for that reason I am going to create\\na function\\nor let's not create a function I am just\\ngoing to create a variable that will\\nkeep track of the current page so we\\nhave the current page at zero now I can\\ncopy this current page\\nand here in the bottom navigation bar we\\nrequire two things on tap and current\\nindex so we can pass in the current\\nindex which will be current page so this\\nis the correct index so this is the\\nitem that we have selected also here\\nyou'll have to pass an i in current page\\nis equal to one and then when you\\nrestart the app you see\\nthis thing is active now\\nand the home is the zeroth element or\\nthe zeroth page so yeah\\njust restart the app and you'll see the\\ndifference\\nso now whenever this item is being\\ntapped on we want to change the current\\npage so that will reflect those changes\\nright so for that we can use the ontap\\nproperty given by bottom navigation bar\\nor alternative option was to wrap this\\nbottom navigation bar item\\nwith the gesture detector but that isn't\\nallowed because this wants a list of\\nbottom navigation bar items you cannot\\nput a gesture detector here because\\ngesture detector is a widget not\\nparticularly bottom navigation bar item\\nonly\\nso let's go ahead and pass the on tap\\nhere and the on Tab will have a value we\\nare going to set State and we are going\\nto set the state of current page equal\\nto the value this will give us\\nand then what I'm going to do is Click\\nover here you see there is a smooth\\nchange over here so we are able to\\nchange the item in the\\napp but still we are not able to figure\\nout\\nhow to change the screen how do I show\\nthis particular cart page for this\\nparticular home screen\\nor how do I show the home page on the\\nhome screen or when the home screen is\\nactive and how do I show cart page when\\nthis is active\\nso to do that I'll have to do one thing\\nI'll have to extract the entire body out\\nin a separate widget of its own so let's\\ncopy this entire widget and let's call\\nthis product list\\nso we are going to have in the lib\\nfolder a file product underscore list\\ndot dot then we are going to import\\nmaterial.dot\\nand then we are going to create a\\nstateless widget\\nwhich will be product list and here I am\\ngoing to return\\nthis entire widget I'll make sure you\\nunderstand the purpose but as of now\\njust follow along also this requires a\\nborder to be passed in and this is the\\nBorder\\nwe are basically taking a widget out\\nfrom here and putting it in its separate\\nown Widget the reason for that I'll\\nmention in just a minute\\nalso we want filters so we'll have to\\nconvert this product list to a stateful\\nwidget because all the chip and filter\\nstuff is inside of it\\nand then we can take this final string\\nfilters out put it in a list come back\\nover here\\nthen you're going to have a selected\\nfilter then we are going to have our\\ninit State and then I'm just going to\\npass in my product list like this okay\\nso I've successfully extracted out\\nthe product list widget into a separate\\nwidget of its own also I'll copy or cut\\nall of these import lines and put it\\ninside of the product list so now all\\nthe errors from product list are also\\ngone\\nbecause things like Global variables so\\nthis thing over here requires Global\\nvariables\\nwhere is it the products yup\\nthen product card and product Details\\npage everything is required and now if I\\nrestart you won't see any visible\\ndifferences on the app it will still\\nfeel the same way what has changed\\nhowever is we have access to this\\nproduct list now changing from\\none screen to another becomes easier how\\nwell I'll show it to you what I'm going\\nto do is create a list of widget which\\nwill be\\npages and that will be equal to an empty\\nlist with\\nproduct list passed to it and\\na cart page so we have to go ahead and\\ncreate\\ncard underscore page dot dot import\\nmaterial dot for it\\nthen we are going to create a stateless\\nwidget call it card page then we are\\ngoing to return a scaffold a body\\nwith a centered text and we are going to\\nname it cart\\npage so as of now this is what the card\\npage looks like however we are going to\\nfill that in we're going to create that\\nUI really soon so let's copy this card\\npage and have it over here let's paste\\nit sweet\\nso we are going to have const like this\\nperfect so we have a list of pages now\\nand that Pages includes product list and\\ncart page so this is the page that we\\nwant to show\\nand how do we want to show it well if we\\nare on zeroth page we want to show the\\nproduct list\\nif we are on\\nfirst page I want to show the cart page\\nso we can have that if condition over\\nhere right I can just have if current\\npage is equal to 0\\nthen I'm going to have product list\\notherwise I'm going to have\\ncart page\\nand that should work right so if we just\\nrestart you see card page is showing up\\nif I go to home page home page is\\nshowing up and it does that correctly\\nhowever one small Improvement here could\\nbe if we just do Pages at current page\\npause the video and give yourself a time\\nto understand what I've done if you\\ndon't understand watch the next part\\nso what I've done over here is\\nI have Pages product list and card so if\\ncurrent page is zero then I'll access\\nthe product list which is Pages at zero\\nif current page is one then I'll access\\nPages at 1 which is cart page\\nso I'm basically\\nperforming the same task but really\\nsmartly\\nif I add more pages further in the app I\\ncan quickly change it\\nso this is the thing I don't have to use\\nthe ternary operator anymore and this\\nfeels better however one problem here is\\nthat whenever I scroll and go to another\\npage then come back everything starts\\nfrom scratch you know it just starts\\nfrom everything I want that scroll\\nposition to be maintained if I come over\\nhere come back the scroll position\\nshould be maintained so for that we have\\na widget called index stack what index\\nstack does is it stores everything in a\\nstack\\nand by Stack I mean it will just keep on\\npiling stuff so the state doesn't really\\ngo the state is still persisted in\\nindexed stack so it requires children\\nand\\nthe children here are the pages so we\\ncan just pass pages over here\\nbecause children requires list of widget\\nand pages is a list of widgets so we can\\npass that in\\nand now the next thing we want is index\\nso that it knows what page it is on and\\nthe index for us is current page now if\\nyou do that restart\\ncome back over here\\nscroll and come back the scroll position\\nis maintained you see if I leave it at\\nadded us like this come here come back\\nadded our scroll position is still\\nmaintained\\nso index stack allows us to do this\\nand I hope you understood why I\\nextracted out the product list it was\\njust so that we could toggle between\\nthis part let me highlight it out this\\npart of the app\\nand\\nit will keep on changing based on\\nwhether we select one bottom navigation\\nbar item or another the next thing I\\nwant to do is make sure that the icons\\nover here are bigger\\nso for that we can set some properties\\nfor our bottom navigation bar\\nwhat we can do here is set an eigen size\\nand the icon size here can be 35 save it\\nand this looks bigger and I like it\\nthe next thing over here is that this\\napp bar is quite big or the bottom\\nnavigation bar is quite big even on\\nAndroid and that's there because\\nthe label occupies some space for\\nexample if I pass in home the home is\\ndisplayed over here you see\\nand the home is displayed that means\\nlabel is taking up the space even when\\nit's empty so what I want to do is make\\nsure that the selected font size is 0\\nand unselected font size is also zero if\\nboth of them are zero it will take\\nlesser space you see and now it works\\nfine it works well and it looks good in\\nmy opinion perfect now let's go ahead\\nand design the cart page how do we want\\nthe cart page to look like\\nso let's close all the save file we're\\ngoing to go to the left folder and\\ncreate\\nor we already have the card page created\\nwe'll just go there and start designing\\nso in our scaffold the first thing that\\nis required is an app bar just saying\\nthat hey\\nwe are using the cart page so we'll have\\na title of app Carter\\nnow you'll notice in\\nhome page that I have a scaffold body\\nindex stack and in the body I have again\\nmentioned a scaffold so there's a\\nscaffold inside of a scaffold and that\\nworks fine as long as you don't have an\\napp bar now if you create an app bar\\nhere\\nlet's just create it for now if you have\\nan app or over here it will look quite\\nweird\\nbecause you have one app bar and then a\\nsecond app bar so definitely you can put\\na scaffold inside of a scaffold but it\\ncan look weird so anyways now we have\\nthe given constraints in which we have\\nto put a scaffold\\nbut our constraint is very clear the\\nentire screen except this part you know\\nthe bottom navigation bar so our\\nconstraint is this entire thing you can\\nsee\\nokay\\nso we'll come over here and let's start\\ndisplaying stuff so to display the stuff\\nwe can just use a list view Builder\\ndirectly nothing else just unless you\\nbuild up\\nbecause we don't have anything else to\\nmention\\nand here we will also mention the\\nitem count which will be\\ngot dot length and this cart is coming\\nfrom Global variables here if you've\\ncopied stuff from\\nthe link mentioned in the description\\nbelow\\nyou might have also copied this card\\nand this card contains just one item\\nwhich is the Jordan shoes all right now\\nyou can use that Also let's put context\\nindex inside of an item Builder\\nnow if you're wondering and I didn't\\nanswer this before why is there a\\ncontext we understand why there is an\\nindex why is there a context and context\\nis basically available in all Builder\\nrelated\\nstuff for example if you add future\\nBuilder you could have a context there\\nif you just have a builder widget which\\nis a builder it's which is a widget of\\nitself you'll get a context there as\\nwell\\nso basically whenever you have Builder\\nyou will have a context and if you're\\nwondering what the Builder widget does\\nI'm not talking about listview Builder\\nthe Builder widget only it basically\\njust provides a context to you\\nwhich you can use\\nand it does have a significance of its\\nown it will provide you with the build\\ncontext that is not same as this context\\nnow in the item here what I want is\\nfinal cart item which will be equal to\\ncart at particular index now what do we\\nreturn here well it's a very simple\\nchoice I just want to return a tile that\\nhas one heading one subheading an image\\nof the\\nthing we have in cart and a delete\\nbutton if I want to remove it from the\\ncard so for that particular reason what\\nI'm going to return from here is a\\nwidget that you've never seen before and\\nthat is the list style widget\\nso usually whenever you have list view\\nBuilder list tile goes well because well\\nit has all the necessary properties you\\nmight need to return\\nso it has a title that will help you to\\ndisplay a title stuff so let's have a\\ntext widget here this accepts a widget\\nand the text can be cart item at title\\ndot to string\\nso we have a title that is good\\nthen it also has a subtitle\\nand here also we can pass it a text\\nwhich will be\\ntelling us the size so what number size\\nshoe did the user select so let's say\\nthe user selected a size of 8.\\nremember this is just dummy data\\nwhen we add State Management to the app\\nwhich is the next step we will be able\\nto dive more into it so we can just have\\ncart item at size that just looks good\\nnow if you come over here you'll see\\nJordan shoes size 8. perfect\\nthe only problem I have is the title is\\nnot bolded so let's go ahead and bold it\\nout so I'm going to use style property\\nhere but I'm not going to mention the\\nnormal style I'll go to the main dot dot\\nfile and I'm going to copy this\\nbody small\\ntitle that looks good to me so I'll just\\nhave theme dot off context Dot text\\ntheme dot body small\\nthen I'll save it and this is now bolded\\nand it has the same size as 16. no\\nvisible difference there\\nafter this I want to add an image in the\\nstart showing that this is the shoe\\nyou've selected so I just want to show\\nthat so for that we also have another\\nwidget which is or another property\\nwhich is leading so what leading does is\\nput whatever widget you have in the\\nstart\\nso you can use the leading widget here\\nand pass in a circle Avatar\\nand then you pass in the background\\nimage which is a property to use on\\nCircle Avatar what Circle Avatar\\nbasically does is it gives you a rounded\\nborder where you can describe your\\nbackground color background image\\nforeground image radius minimum radius\\nall of that stuff\\nso here you can pass in a background\\nimage and this requires image provider\\nwhat is our image well it's coming from\\nasset so you can pass in an asset image\\nhere you cannot pass in image dot asset\\nbecause this is a widget\\nimage.asset is a widget however asset\\nimage isn't\\na widget asset image is a network or\\nis a image provider\\nif you see here asset image and go into\\nthe definition of the source code you'll\\nsee asset image extends asset buttonal\\nimage provider and it extends an image\\nprovider so it's an image provider it's\\nnot a widget image dot asset is a widget\\nsee here it requires image providers you\\ncan pass an asset image\\nand if you're getting stuff from Network\\nor from web you can use Network image\\nso let's go ahead and use asset image\\nand pass in the asset my asset is cart\\nitem will go to Global variables and we\\nhave image URL so we'll pass in image\\nURL and we'll treat it as a string\\nperfect\\nwe save it and we have our shoes showing\\nup\\nnow what if I want to increase the size\\nof this\\nCircle that we have Circle Avatar has\\nproperties for that as well you can also\\nset the radius property that will help\\nyou to change the\\nsize of it so let's say the radius is 45\\nso this is quite big and there you go\\nbut I don't want it this big I want it\\n30 let's say\\nthat's fine and if you want to change\\nthe background color over here you can\\nchange it the yellow color is there just\\nbecause of the theming we have set in\\nthe overall app and the last thing I\\nrequired here is a delete icon now there\\nare two things you can do away for the\\ndelete icon either you can add a button\\nover here that says hey you can remove\\nthis item from the card or you can have\\na swiping gesture saying if you swipe\\nthis you can delete the item in the cart\\nor you just long press on it and you can\\ndelete it what I'm going to do is add an\\nicon over here that says you can delete\\nstuff\\nthis is helpful because\\nthe user doesn't have to swipe through\\nor if the user doesn't know that they\\nhave to swipe to remove from the cart\\nit's helpful\\nso now you can have a trailing widget\\nhere which will be an icon button\\nand on press is required so what should\\nhappen if it is removed for now nothing\\nand then icons dot delete\\nokay\\nsave it you come over here and you have\\nthe delete icon now the delete icon\\nisn't in its original fashion in its\\noriginal fashion it should be in the red\\ncolor so let's get it red so we're going\\nto have a const icon icons dot delete\\nand we're also going to press or pass\\nthe color which is colors dot red\\nand I'm not setting the theme away I'm\\ngenerally typing colors.red because no\\nmatter what the theme of our app is the\\ndelete button has to be red color\\nand we have a delete button cool so we\\nhave our cart layout set up as well now\\nthe next thing we need to add in our app\\nis State Management so how do we manage\\nthe global state in our app we already\\ndo that with\\nset state so we are the local state\\nmanagement but what should happen if I\\nclick on add to cart\\nand it should show up in the card here\\nI've already explained all the stuff\\nrelated to State Management and\\ninherited widget which is what flutter\\nuses behind the scenes to have State\\nManagement but we are going to take a\\nlook at an abstraction over\\ninherited widget why because inherited\\nwidget can be a bit cumbersome to write\\nevery single time it is quite a big\\nsource code to write and yeah if you\\nwant to know more about it link is\\nmentioned in the description you should\\ndefinitely check out the video by the\\nflutter team themselves\\nso now let's dive into the State\\nManagement world and we are going to\\nmanage a state using provider so for\\nState Management we are going to take\\nhelp of an external dependency and for\\nthat I can go to pub.dev and the package\\nwe'll be using is provider\\nthis provider package is a wrap around\\ninherited Widget the widget that I\\nexplained to you but we did not write\\nand it is a wrapper around inherited\\nwidget to make them easier to use and it\\nis more reusable\\nby using provider instead of manually\\nwriting inherited widget\\nyou get all of these features\\nall right and it's a good thing\\nthere are other State Management options\\nyou can use as well there's riverpod\\nwhich is my personal favorite and you\\ncan find that in the video I'll\\nmentioned in the description below you\\ncan check out my separate tutorial on it\\nand after that I would recommend you to\\nfollow with the project of Reddit clone\\nso that you get a proper practical\\nunderstanding of using riverpod in your\\napps and another famous library that\\npeople like to use is block and there's\\nanother package that people like to use\\nin the flutter Community which is get X\\nbut I personally do not like it and\\nit is the most liked package on pub.dev\\nso it's the most like package in flutter\\nbut I personally do not like using it\\nand you can find my video on why I don't\\nlike using it in the description as well\\nso we are not going to take a look at\\nget at all and even block\\nbut riverpod you can find in the video\\ndescription let's go ahead and use\\nprovider now how should we use provider\\nso the documentation or usage for it can\\nbe found in the\\nyeah\\nbut I'm going to tell you how to use it\\nbecause that's what the aim is right now\\nwe can copy this go to pubspect.aml\\nand add it to the dependencies\\nand then save it now I will get rid of\\nit\\nand we'll start all our apps from\\nscratch now provider runs on every\\nmachine so it can work on all the\\nplatforms you can see it over here so\\nthat's fine and at the end of the day it\\nis just a wrapper around inherited\\nwidget which basically means like it is\\nbuilt on inherited widget with a slight\\nwrapper which allows you to use it very\\neasily and it is a flood of favorite\\npackage so flutter recommends using this\\nhowever the creator of this package is\\nnot the Google team\\nit is the team or it is the person that\\ncreated the riverpod package as well and\\nhe recommends using this package\\nover provider\\nhowever we are going to use provider\\nbecause that will give us a clearer\\ninsight into inherited widget\\nRiver pod doesn't do that anyways let's\\njust focus on provider and remove Revo\\npod out of the picture\\nnow here let's add provider so the first\\nthing to do in provider and I told you\\nabout this in inherited widget\\nexplanation as well that\\nhow inherited widget works is it creates\\na storehouse at the top of a widget\\nor at the top of the widget tree\\nso we can do the same we can go to the\\nmain dot dot and we can wrap our\\nmaterial app with something known as a\\nprovider widget\\nokay this provide a widget is coming\\nfrom the provider package and it extends\\ninherited provider in edited provider\\nextends single child stateless widget\\nthis extends a stateless widget so this\\nis a widget\\nthat you can use\\nand the task of this provider is to\\nstore this data\\nand you store this data using the create\\noption wire send create you pass any\\nvalue it accepts Dynamic value which is\\nbasically like hey you can pass anything\\nyou want it can be your own custom class\\nyou get can be a string so let's go\\nahead and return a string from here with\\njust saves hello world all right I'm\\njust showing you how to use provider in\\nyour apps so you can build\\nor provide value from one place to\\nanother\\nso what you've done is at the top of the\\nwidget tree you said hey we have a\\nprovider and the descending widgets can\\nuse this value\\nso whatever value we're returning the\\ndescending widgets can use it and if you\\nhover over this it is automatically\\ngetting a type of Provider string so\\nwhatever value you type over here will\\nbe the type of this provider\\ncool now we can go to the cart page\\nlet's say\\nnow the thing we have to concentrate on\\nis how do I get this value how do I get\\nthe value hello world in my cart page\\nwell you can do that by printing\\nprovider\\ndot of context\\nand here\\nwe have to mention a generic type now\\nyou already know provider.off context\\nsyntax right it is the inherited widget\\nsyntax\\nexactly\\nbut this also requires a generic type if\\nyou mention a generic type it will be\\nable to find the provider so if we have\\nstring here and then let's just say we\\nprinted\\nyou see hello world is written if I\\nrestart the app hello world is written\\nhow does this work how are we getting\\nthe value in my app in the cart Page by\\nnot even giving arguments and that is\\nthe beauty of provider and inherited\\nwidget\\nwe mentioned hello world over here so\\nthis was a provider of type string then\\nwe called provider dot off context so it\\nwent up the widget tree trying to find\\nthe nearest ancestor\\nto provide a DOT off string\\nso it\\nsearched the type of Provider string all\\nright it went up the widget tree and\\ntried to find a provider which was like\\nthis provider string and then when it\\nfinally founded\\nit returned the value\\nnow what if I have two providers instead\\nof one\\nso I have one provider at the root of\\nthe widget tree and let's say I have\\nanother\\nwhich is wrapping the home page all\\nright I have a provider here which wraps\\nthe home page and let's say we say hello\\nalso this requires a function so let's\\npass in a function all right\\ncool\\nnow if we restart we see Hello written\\nover here hello world is gone now only\\nHello is returned and that's because\\nprovider dot off context is trying to\\nfind the nearest widget to it\\nor the nearest widget in the widget tree\\nand the nearest widget is this part over\\nhere\\nthat's why we get hello we don't get\\nhello and hello world both because once\\nit finds the particular provider it will\\nstop looking for any more providers it's\\ndone so it doesn't look any further\\nit will give the value given by this\\nhello perfect\\nso now that we have used provider\\nI want to tell you that there are\\nmultiple types of providers there are\\nproviders like provider we've already\\nseen this then we have changed Notifier\\nprovider\\nthen we have a future provider and then\\nwe have a stream provider so these are\\nthe four main types of providers that\\nyou can use in your app\\nprovider we have already seen is a\\nread-only value so you can just provide\\none value and it will only read it will\\ndo nothing else then there's change\\nnodifier provider with this provider you\\ncan change the values\\nand notify the widgets that are\\nlistening to it about those changes\\nthis is the provider we want in our\\nshopping app then we have future\\nprovider so future provider is there so\\nthat it can listen to Futures subscribe\\nto them and show the changes\\nand stream provider is basically\\nproviding a stream\\nfuture and stream providers are useful\\nbecause provider helps in lazy loading\\nright\\nso it can help over there and that is a\\ngood thing however we'll be only\\nfocusing on change nodifier Provider\\nfrom now so instead of returning a\\nprovider which is a read-only value we\\ndon't need that anymore we're going to\\nreturn a change nodifier provider\\nbut if I just do change Notifier\\nprovider\\nit's not enough\\nwe need to provide a generic type of\\nerror and a generic type as let's say\\nstring but string doesn't conform to the\\nboundary of change node file basically\\nwhenever you have change Notifier\\nprovider\\nand you have a create function you\\ncannot pass in a string or anything you\\nneed to pass in something known as a\\nchange node file okay and what is this\\nchange Notifier it is a simple class in\\nthe flutter SDK which we can use so it's\\ncoming from flutter not from provider\\nand what this does is provides change\\nnotification to whatever is listening to\\nit so\\nif any updates are made or anything is\\ndone it will notify the widgets\\nlistening to it and will rebuild those\\nchanges\\nbut now we cannot just use change\\nNotifier like this we have to use it a\\nlittle bit differently what we need to\\ndo is create our own separate class so\\nlet's call\\nour provider as cart provider.dot then\\nwe are going to have class card provider\\nI always like to\\nhave anything related to provider using\\ncart provider\\nso it's clear for me to know\\nif it's a provider or not then we have\\nto extend this with change node F5 all\\nright as soon as you extend change\\nNotifier you can take this class and\\nreturn it over here so you can return\\ncard provider over here now\\nthis card provider is accessible\\nthroughout your entire app so whatever\\nyou define over here can be used outside\\nof this class\\nin the home page in the cart page\\nanywhere in your app and that's a plus\\nright so this just tells us that if I\\nclick on add to cart and I store it in\\ncart provider then I'll be able to see\\nit in the card screen if I use the same\\ncard provider and that's exactly what we\\nare going to do\\nthis card provider is a storehouse right\\nat the top so here I'm going to create a\\nvariable call this\\nfinal\\nmap string comma Dynamic cart and that\\nis equal to an empty list\\nbut here a value of type less Dynamic\\ncannot be assigned to a variable of type\\nmap string dynamic\\nit's basically saying that hey\\nyour card is a map of string comma\\nDynamic how are you assigning to this to\\na list and that's true my card cannot be\\njust a map if it's just a map I'll be\\nable to store one single product I want\\nto store multiple products so I need to\\nhave a list\\nokay now that I have a list I can create\\ntwo functions add product\\nand remove product so I'm going to have\\nremove product\\nso two functions are present in cart\\nprovider which we can use so in add\\nproduct we are going to get one product\\nwhich we need to add to our cart so I\\ncan have map string comma Dynamic\\nproduct\\nthen I'm going to do cart dot add\\nproduct simple\\nnow the same thing is going to happen in\\nthe remove product as well I'm going to\\nget a product here and then I'm going to\\ndo cart dot remove product\\nso this way my card provider is up and\\nready as simple as that\\nsince the instance of this class is\\naccessible throughout our entire app I\\ncan go to one particular page and where\\nI want to go to is product Details page\\nI hope you understood what happened in\\ncard provider I created a class extended\\nit using change Notifier so that I could\\nuse it in main.dot in the card provider\\nover here\\nand then what I did is ADD product added\\nit to the cart list remove product those\\nare just functions and now whenever this\\nadd to cart button is clicked on\\nI'm going to\\ncall this particular function\\nokay so let's go ahead and do it so I'm\\ngoing to go to the product Details page\\nthen I'm going to go to the elevated\\nbutton on pressed and here I'm going to\\nhave provider\\ndot of context and here I need to\\nmention the type what is the type of my\\nprovider now if you want to take a look\\nat it you can come over here\\nand the type of provider is cart\\nprovider you can use that so you'll have\\nprovider.off cart\\nprovider\\nDot and you have the option to add a\\nproduct\\nnow I'm just going to click on ADD\\nproduct\\nand then I will mention my map what is\\nmy map\\nwell it's this thing product but you see\\nI can't access product over here and I\\ncan't access it because I'm in a\\nstateful widget whenever I'm in a\\nstateful widget I am unable to access\\nthis product then how did we do it\\nearlier\\nwidget.parada but we didn't write widget\\ndot product right\\nflutter did it for ourselves so when we\\nadd stateless to stateful widget\\nconversion we wrote widget it\\nautomatically converted product to\\nwidget dot product because we are in a\\nseparate class of ourselves right\\nhow do we access element of this class\\nwe cannot do that\\nthat's why state has created a widget\\nproperty or a widget getter for us which\\nwe can use to access Constructor\\narguments or whatever we want to do and\\nthat's how we get access to widget dot\\nproduct\\nso I can add the product like this\\nand now just to see if it is working\\nI'll press command J\\nI'll restart my entire app and I'm\\ngetting an error\\nI am getting an error saying the\\nfollowing provider not found exception\\nwas thrown building card page so the\\nerror is in card page and the error here\\nis that provider.off string context was\\ncalled and there's no provider which\\nReturns the string for us in the entire\\nwidget tree we had it but we removed it\\nand replaced it with cart provider so\\nthis no longer exists that's why we get\\nprovider not found exception so when a\\nprovider doesn't exist in your direct\\nwidget tree\\nthat's when you get provider not found\\nexception\\nso let's remove or not remove Provider\\nfrom here we are going to print provider\\ndot of context\\ncart\\nprovider\\nDot card so we're going to print this\\nthing out and now I'm going to restart\\nmy app I see an empty list I come over\\nhere I click on add to cart and I get an\\narrow\\nthe error says that I tried to listen to\\na value exposed with Provider from\\noutside of the widget tree\\nnow this error basically occurred\\nand you can see the reason below this is\\nlikely caused by an event handler like a\\nbuttons on press that called provider\\ndot off without passing listen false\\nbasically whenever you use\\nprovider dot off\\ncontext you always have to listen to\\nstuff you're just saying that hey I'm\\nsubscribed to cart provider now any\\nchanges made to cart providers any of\\nthe services I want to subscribe to them\\nI want to listen to all of those changes\\nthat's what change Notifier also does\\nwhen you extend to a change Notifier it\\nwill notify all the widgets that are\\nlistening to it about its state change\\nhere what happened is you're saying\\nprovider.off card provider context so\\nyou're basically saying that hey I want\\nto listen to card provider but then\\nyou're calling add product function on\\nit so you're not really listening you're\\njust\\ncalling a function so whenever you're\\ncalling a function\\nbeside the context you also need to\\nprovide one thing which is listen and\\nset it to false by default listen is set\\nto true in our cart page the listen is\\nset to true all right\\nbut here you're saying listen is false\\nand then add product and listen should\\nbe false\\nevery time you use this function out of\\nthe build\\nfunction all right whenever you use\\nprovider dot off card provider context\\nout of the build function\\nlisten should be set to false and if\\nyou're in on pressed it is basically out\\nof the build function because you can\\ntake this on pressed and put it like\\nthis void\\non tap\\nlike this right so you're now out of the\\nbuild function and then you can pass on\\nTab\\nso now you're out of the build function\\nand it still works fine now you might\\nraise a question hey how are we using\\nbuild context when we are out of the\\nbuild function build context is there\\nonly over here how can you use it over\\nhere I can use it over here thanks to\\nthe state class that we are extending\\nthis date class also gives us access to\\nthe build context and this build context\\nthat the state provides and this build\\ncontext is the exact same thing it is\\nthe exact same element so you can use it\\nwherever you want\\nbut yeah in a stateless Widget the\\ncontext is not given because\\nthis context is given by the state class\\nit is not given by state full widget\\nso stateless widget cannot give that\\nonly state can and obviously in a\\nstateless widget we do not extend state\\ngreat\\nso now that we are in a\\nfunction outside of the build function\\nwe are using listen false and anytime\\nyou want to call a function from card\\nprovider you have to set listen to false\\nif you said listen to true you're\\nbasically saying that hey\\nI'm\\nin the widget tree I want to\\ncontinuously listen to the changes and\\nthat's definitely not the case over here\\nanyways now that we have understood this\\nwe'll restart the app we'll come over\\nhere we'll add to cart let's open the\\nterminal nothing shows up\\nand there's still an empty list\\nif I add to cart again still nothing\\nworks\\nif I go back come here let's say add to\\ncart\\nstill nothing works\\nso why is this not working\\nwell this is not working because\\nwhenever you use\\nchange Notifier or extend change\\nNotifier\\nit doesn't do anything automatically\\nit only notifies the\\nwidgets listening to it when you call a\\nparticular function which is notify\\nlisteners and this function is given by\\nchange Notifier itself\\nso you extend change Notifier and you\\nsee it is a mixing class so you can also\\ndo card provider with change notify or\\nextends to notify same thing and as soon\\nas you do notify listeners and restart\\nyour entire app come to men's Nike shoes\\nadd to cart\\ncommand J and now you see automatically\\nyou have access to\\nthe changes made over here and this data\\nis coming from the card page so you\\nupdate it one place and the data is\\nstored in some other place that's the\\ncool thing right\\nnow in the card provider we are going to\\ndo the same thing for notify listeners\\nof a remove product so when you remove a\\nproduct you can have notify listeners\\nlike this\\nso notify listeners just notifies all\\nthe things that are listening to this\\ncard provider sweet now the problem I\\nhave right now is I cannot display the\\ndata that is coming from this cart\\nthat's because sizes is giving me a list\\nand it's just giving me a product\\nwhat I want\\nis something like this I want ID title\\nprice image URL company all written over\\nhere but I also want size\\nsince I want size over here I'll have to\\nmodify this widget dot product a little\\nbit\\nso how are we going to do this\\nwell we can have something like this\\nso what I'm going to do is copy this\\nthis is the layout in which I want my\\nproduct\\nor my cart product then I can have it\\nlike this then I mentioned the ID so the\\nID is widget dot product at ID and the\\nsame thing for literally every single\\nthing we have widget dot product title\\nwidget dot product\\nthen we have price then we have widget\\ndot product image URL\\nand do that for everything all right\\nso you have image URL here and finally\\nwidget product\\nfor the company\\nsweet and the size here is going to be\\nthe selected size\\nalso you can add an if condition over\\nhere what if the user does not select a\\nsize\\nwhat do we want to do in that case well\\nfirst of all I don't want to update my\\ncart\\notherwise it will come like selected\\nsize is 0. and that's a wrong thing\\nbecause a shoe cannot have a size of\\nzero so I'll just have if selected size\\nis equal to 0\\nthen\\nI want to do something else\\nso I'll just have a reverse condition if\\nselected size is not equal to 0\\nthen I'm just going to paste it over\\nhere\\nso if selected size is not zero it is\\nsomething else\\nand that has to be from some selected\\nsize we have decided\\nthen we can go ahead\\nso now we restart\\ncome over here let's say I add to cart\\nnothing gets added to the cart and this\\nis kind of like a bad user feedback you\\ncan say because what's happening here is\\nyou add to cart the user doesn't really\\nknow that they have to select a size\\nmaybe they forgot to do that\\nso you have to tell the users that hey\\nyou need to select a size\\nso here in the else condition you can\\ntell the users that and here I want to\\nbasically show\\na thing popping up from below saying\\nthat hey you need to\\nselect a size\\nso for that we have something known as\\nscaffold messenger\\nnot scaffold\\nscaffoldmessenger dot off context again\\nthis is using inherited widget behind\\nthe scenes and I'll explain why Dot\\nand this has multiple things like show\\nmaterial Banner remove current snack bar\\nall of that what we want is show snack\\nbar and this requires something known as\\nsnack bar so let's pass it in then snack\\nbar requires content so let's pass the\\ncontent which will be a text because\\ncontent requires a widget and then you\\nsay\\nplease select a size\\nokay and then we are going to put a cons\\nfor the snack bar and once we come over\\nhere let's go back come over here\\nadd to cart you see please select a size\\nso this is our scaffold messenger\\nshowing up why does this use a narrated\\nwidget because it wants to show the\\nsnack bar on one particular screen and\\nhere it is just contacting the messenger\\nof a scaffold all right earlier this was\\nknown as scaffold.off context but then\\nit caused some problems with build\\ncontext\\nand cause problems like build context\\nnot found that's why this was renamed to\\nscaffold messenger\\nso what happens is it's it Finds Its\\nnearest scaffold\\nnow it Finds Its nearest scaffold\\nmessenger and shows a snack bar on that\\nparticular scaffold and what is the\\nsnack bar snack bar is a thing that\\nshows up from the below giving us\\nan impression that hey you need to do\\nsomething\\nokay\\nso now if I select a size add to cart\\nit will be added to cart but I still\\nhave no clue that it was added to my\\ncart so what I can add here is again a\\nscaffold messenger and a snack bar\\nsaying\\nproduct\\nadded successfully\\nsave it\\nthen you again select some other product\\nlet's say this then you have product\\nadded successfully you go back come over\\nhere\\nand you won't be able to see the changes\\nbecause our card does not depend on it\\nbut the changes are reflected over here\\nnow let's go ahead and make the changes\\nover here in our cart page\\nnow whenever you want to continuously\\nlisten to something in relation to a\\nprovider we have to do that in the build\\ncontext otherwise lesson will be set to\\nfalse and we won't be able to listen to\\nanything\\nso let's save our final card is this\\nthing over here\\nthen we'll remove Global variables and\\nas thing is done\\nso the item count is card dot length\\ncart item is cart at index\\nand now it's safe to say that we can\\nremove cart from our app\\nthe dummy data still needs to be there\\nnow we can close all the save files we\\nare going to restart our app\\nall the data is now gone because\\nthe provider doesn't store data\\npermanently in our storage it only\\nstores it temporarily as long as the app\\nis running after you restart or reset\\nthe app it is all gone\\nso let's go ahead and select 11 size\\nthen we'll go to Adidas shoes We'll add\\na 10 size\\nthen we'll add a Jordan shoes and add\\neight size then we come to the cart and\\nwe see three things men's Nike shoes\\nsize 11 10 8 and all the proper images\\nare showing up perfect\\nthe last thing I want to work on is this\\ndelete product\\nso whenever I delete something from your\\nit should remove it from my cart\\nbut even before doing that I want a\\nconfirmation I want my app to ask them\\nare you sure you want to remove this\\nproduct if you're sure only then we'll\\nremove it for you\\nwe already have the remove product\\nfunction ready all we need to do is\\nput up a dialog box what we want is\\nwhenever we click on this particular\\nbutton it should show up a dialog box\\nright in the center saying delete choose\\nor delete from to delete product are you\\nsure you want to remove products from\\ncart and then you have two options no\\nyes so this is what you want to do let's\\ngo ahead and do that really quickly\\nso in card page\\nWhenever there is on pressed you can\\nhave something known as show dialog\\nthis show dialog is a function given by\\nflutter that will allow you to display\\nUI it will allow you to show a dialogue\\non the screen\\nand then it has a builder so you get a\\ncontext and you can use that context to\\ndisplay stuff now this Builder requires\\nyou to return a widget from this\\nfunction of build context that it's\\ngiving\\nnow what do we want to return well I\\njust want to return a dialogue let's say\\nif I have a dialog\\nwill that work well let's go ahead and\\ntry it out you see when I click over\\nhere the screen does get blurred\\nthat's because of our dialogue now I'll\\npass a child here and the child is let's\\nsay text and we say are you sure\\nthen become aware we select we see a\\ndialogue saying are you sure\\nso you can set it up for yourself you\\nknow you can design dialogues on your\\nown I have that much faith in you at the\\nend of the day we are returning a widget\\nso you can use container padding column\\nall of your creativity to return a\\nparticular dialogue but if you don't\\nwant to do all of this there is a\\nbuilt-in widget called alert dialog\\nwhich you can use and I like to use it\\nfor this kind of stuff\\nthis basically tells you to show an\\nalert dialogue that hey you're doing\\nsomething\\nthat is a bit risky not exactly risky in\\nthis case you're just removing a product\\nfrom your cart but it just verifies that\\nhey you're doing this\\nso let's go ahead and set it up it\\nrequires a title which is exactly what\\nwe want so we are going to have\\ndelete product as the title\\nnow when we click over here delete\\nproduct is the title\\nand you see that this is quite big I\\ndon't want it this big and the reason\\nit's big is because the title has\\na style it is\\ninheriting from\\nwe can override that by having theme\\ndot off context Dot\\ntext theme\\nDot\\nlet's say body medium save it\\nthis doesn't look very good so I'm going\\nto go with something large which is\\ntitle large let's say now if I click\\nover here this is quite big\\nmaybe we want title medium\\nand this looks good enough\\nso we have delete product as the main\\ntitle after that we need something like\\na subtitle\\nand there's nothing like a subtitle but\\nwe do have content\\nso what is our content well very simply\\nit is a text saying are you sure you\\nwant to remove\\nthe product\\nfrom your cart\\nokay\\nthis is my content this is my text\\nwidget\\njust asking it are you sure you want to\\ndo this\\nbecause this is an alert dialogue it\\njust asks for your confirmation now if I\\nclick over here we see this this is\\nlooking good\\nthe last thing I want here is a no and a\\nyes button so that the users can select\\naccordingly\\nand for that we have something given by\\nalert dialog which is actions actions is\\nthe same thing that is available on the\\napp bar as well which you can use to add\\naction related stuff\\nthings that you want to mention over\\nhere\\nand the same thing is here as well if\\nyou want to mention something so I want\\ntwo things over here\\ntwo text buttons basically the first\\nvertex button is going to be a text\\nsaying\\nno\\nalso this will be a constant text no and\\nthen there's going to be another text\\nbutton which is going to be yes all\\nright\\nnow if we click over here\\nwe don't see the buttons but they are\\nthere no and yes now we just have to\\nchange their design\\nso for this we'll have to set up the\\nstyle and everything so let's go ahead\\nand\\npass the style as\\ntext button or actually we don't need to\\ndo this we can just mention the style\\nover here for the text textile now what\\nis the color of no going to be well I\\njust want it to be\\ncolors.blue because no is a safer option\\nand the other option Also let's put\\nfontway dot boldier and the other option\\nwhich I'm going to copy paste is yes\\nand that is going to be colors.red\\nnow if you click over here yes is there\\nno is there you can select either of\\nthem\\nyou can set more properties on this show\\ndialog basically like if you want to\\ndisallow the user from clicking outside\\nright now if I click outside of the\\ndialog I can still exit but if you want\\nto make sure the users can avoid that\\nyou can set barrier dismissable to false\\nonce you do that the users won't be\\nallowed to click outside\\nand exited like this I can't exert it\\neven though I'm clicking\\nbut anyways I like this better so I'm\\ngoing to keep it\\nand now I can't exit it so I'm just\\ngoing to restart my app\\nthen add some shoes\\ncome over here and we have men's Nike\\nshoes size 11 and size 12 properly there\\nnow in the know what I want to do is\\nwhenever the user clicks on no I just\\nwant this dialog to go away and do\\nnothing just this dialogue should go\\naway\\nso to make this dialog go away I can use\\nNavigator dot off context dot pop\\nonce I do this\\nand click on no it just removes the\\ndialogue nothing else because what this\\ndialog does is it\\nStacks it it Stacks it at the top of the\\nscreen so navigator.off context dot pop\\nwill just remove it\\nafter this we have yes in yes what do we\\nhave to do well I just want to call\\nprovider dot off context then again I\\nhave to access cart provider\\nthen lesson should be set to false don't\\nforget that dot remove product\\nand what is the product I want to remove\\nthe product is mentioned over here it is\\nthe cart item so you can just mention\\nthe cart item and done\\nnow if you want to remove Adidas shoes\\nyou can click on yes and Adidas shoes\\ngets removed but the dialogue isn't\\npopped off\\nwe still have to call navigator.off\\ncontext dot pop to remove this thing\\nso let's click on no now we have delete\\nbutton yes and will clear off the card\\nfor us now we can go ahead and set\\nthings up let's say 10\\n9\\nand now if I come over here yeah size 10\\nsize 9 and I can remove anything I want\\nand it works fine\\nso this was what I wanted to talk about\\nState Management with provider\\nprovider has its flaws for sure\\nbut this is very close to inherited\\nwidget which is why I wanted to take\\nthis up now there are some things you\\ncan modify here first of all this is a\\nbig line to ride\\nisn't it so what you can do is final\\ncard is equal to context dot watch\\nas soon as you do context.watch provider\\ngets triggered then you have to use the\\ncart provider\\nand there you go\\nyou now have an instance of cart\\nprovider with you now you just have to\\ncall the cart and it will work just as\\nintended\\nso we have context.watch here instead of\\nprovider.off card provider context Dot\\ncard so this is a shorthand Syntax for\\nthe same thing\\nit will work just as expected you can\\ntry it for yourself\\nand here whenever we have\\na function called what we need to do is\\ncontext dot read\\nyou can't use context.watch because\\nlesson Falls means read it isn't watch\\nwatch is basically like your\\ncontinuously seeing read is you just\\nread it once and leave it\\nso again you need to mention card\\nprovider over here and then you can have\\ndot remove product and pass in the\\nparticular card either\\nand you can make these changes\\neverywhere in your app\\nit is just a shorthand Syntax for it it\\nis\\na function which basically does provide\\na DOT off context this lesson Falls\\nand I think this is an extension yeah\\nthis is an extension on build context\\nprovided by flutter\\nso yeah you can you do this to simplify\\nyour life\\nand that works great looks great perfect\\nnow you can make these changes all\\naround your app and this is how it is\\ndone so yeah we are done with State\\nManagement with provider in our shopping\\napp\\none last thing I'd like to mention\\nbefore closing the State Management\\nchapter with provider if you want to\\nreturn multiple providers in a bigger\\napplication what you can do and I'm\\ngoing to remove this comment is return\\nmulti-provider with multi-provider you\\ncan return a list of providers and there\\nyou can mention your change Notifier\\nprovider where you pass in a context and\\nreturn card provider\\nas simple as that so if you have\\nmultiple providers you can pass it in\\nmulti-provider otherwise change Notifier\\nprovider or just provider is fine but\\nmost of the times in bigger apps you\\nwill be using multi-provider only\\nbecause you will have multiple providers\\nthere's a lot less boilerplate code to\\nwrite when using provider as it is a\\nwrapper around inherited widget a widget\\nprovided by flutter itself to pass data\\nbetween other widgets using provider we\\ncan separate business logic from UI\\nmaking our code much easier to test and\\nmaintain in this tutorial we will go\\nthrough different type of providers and\\nunderstand when to use what type of\\nProvider first one is provider itself as\\nthe name suggests provider provides data\\nto visits below it in the widget tree to\\ndemonstrate this I'll wrap the root of\\nmy widget tree with provider this acts\\nlike a storehouse for data\\nwait a minute which data whatever we\\npass in the create argument it can be\\nstring Boolean and even instance of a\\nclass\\nto read this data in a widget we can use\\nprovider dot off then the type of the\\ndata we return followed by context\\nwhat happens behind the scenes is it\\ngoes up the widget Tree finds the\\nprovider widget closest with the type we\\nreturn and spits out the data that's\\nstored we can see the data correctly\\nwhen we display it on the screen as well\\nif you find the syntax really long you\\ncan use context.watch followed by the\\ntype of provider and it will work the\\nsame way provider is a read-only widget\\nwhich means it cannot modify the value\\ninitially passed to it so how do we\\nmodify the values with the help of\\nchange nodifier provider instead of\\nProvider we will pass in chain Notifier\\nprovider and in the create argument pass\\nin a data model\\nto create a data model we will create a\\nClass instantiate A Private variable\\ncreate a getter and a function that\\nincrements the variable's value by 1. to\\nmake this work properly with change\\nnodifier provider extend the class with\\nchain Notifier which provides us with\\nnotify listeners function whenever this\\nfunction is called it notifies chain\\nNotifier provider and widgets listening\\nto it are rebuilt\\nif you don't use notify listeners the UI\\nof the app won't get affected even\\nthough the data in our case counter\\nvariables value changes\\nalso note that more functions like\\ndecrement and reset can be added in the\\nmodel class itself getting data is same\\nfor all providers we just need to\\nspecify the type of Provider properly\\nsince we have counter return in chain\\nnodifier provider we will replace string\\nwith counter but as you can see this\\nreturns instance of the counter class so\\nwe will use counter getter we created in\\nthis class to see the count\\nnow to implement the increment function\\nwe can use this line why let's break it\\ndown provider dot off counter context\\nwill return to us the instance of the\\ncounter class on this instance we are\\ncalling increment function inside of\\nwhich we call notify listeners and this\\nwill rebuild this widget since we are\\nlistening to it but what if I don't want\\nto listen meaning I don't want the\\nwidget to rebuild so I can set listen to\\nfalse for a shorter syntax we can use\\ncontext dot read it's worth noting that\\ncontext.read cannot be called inside\\nbuild function on the other hand\\ncontext.watch cannot be called outside\\nof build function another thing to note\\nis context.watch should generally be\\nused when every part of the widget needs\\nthat value because it makes the entire\\nwidget rebuilt for example when I click\\non the increment button only the counter\\nneeds to rebuild but in reality even the\\ntext and floating action button rebuild\\nthis might not seem like a big\\ndifference but what if you're building\\nTwitter like app and to update the\\nnumber of likes you're rebuilding the\\nwhole postcard to prevent this\\nunnecessary widget rebuild wrap the\\ncounter text with consumer widget which\\nwill make only the widget returning from\\nit rebuild give consumer the return data\\ntype and to get the data we can use\\ninstance of return data type provided to\\nus don't forget to remove your\\ncontext.watch calls otherwise it will\\nstill rebuild the entire widget next\\ntype of provider is stream Provider from\\nthe name itself we know that it will\\nhelp us manage stream data it is like\\nstream Builder but with lesser\\nboilerplate instead of chain Notifier\\nwrap my app with stream provider in the\\ncreate argument pass in a stream like\\nthis in our case it will output 0 to 9\\nwith a gap of 1 second after each number\\ninitial data argument is also required\\nit is the data to be displayed until the\\nabove stream gives us a value to read\\nthis go down to the consumer replace\\ncounter within which is the data type we\\nare returning from stream provider and\\nremove dot counter it works prop if you\\nrestart the app\\nequivalent of consumer in this case will\\nbe the following\\nfuture provider is similar to stream\\nprovider it too accepts initial data and\\ncreate arguments and works the same way\\nso I'm not going to rewrite the whole\\nthing but basic difference is future\\nprovider returns a value after the\\nfuture is completed now we know about\\nmost of the essential providers but here\\ncomes a problem what if I want to use\\nboth stream provider and change Notifier\\nprovided together in the application we\\ncan do something like this right wrap my\\napp with provider pass data in create\\nand in the child change Notifier\\nprovider likewise we can do for hundreds\\nof providers in a vast app right\\nno why use this nesting hell well only a\\nsingle provider can help us which is\\nmulti-provider it accepts list of\\nproviders in the argument and that's it\\nthat's how easy it is to add multiple\\nproviders in our application now the\\nlast provider we're going to look at is\\nproxy provider when one of our provider\\ndepends on value returned from another\\nprovider we use proxy provider to\\ndemonstrate this I'll create another\\nclass in a code called second class and\\naccept instance of Firebase odds from\\nConstructor here we can create any\\nmethod that we want I'll just keep it\\nempty now I want to provide this class\\nso I'll go into the multi provider where\\nFirebase auth is already provided to\\naccess this Firebase auth instance I\\nwill use proxy provider the syntax is\\nlike this proxy provider and unlike\\nother providers we pass two types\\nindependent class and the dependent\\nclass then we need to pass update\\nargument which gives us context followed\\nby instance of the independent and\\ndependent classes we will return the\\nclass from this function passing auth as\\nthe argument this will make a provider\\nwork but what if the class doesn't need\\none but two three even four instances we\\nwill use proxy provider 2 3 4 and so on\\nfor it and that's pretty much it the\\nnext thing I want to do is focus on\\nresponsive UI by responsive UI I mean\\nthe device or our app should look good\\non all screen sizes and that includes\\nChrome\\nMac OS Apple Android all of them it\\nshould look good on all the screen sizes\\nso right now our app looks good on IOS\\nand Android and that's cool but now I'm\\ngoing to switch to Chrome and I'm going\\nto run it on Chrome to see how it looks\\non a bigger screen size all right so\\nlet's launch it\\nand while that is happening I also want\\nto restructure the folder structure now\\nyou see there are many components in our\\nlib folder so obviously we need to\\nsegregate things we need to put all the\\npages in one particular page we want to\\nput providers in one provider\\nand we need to do all of those tasks so\\nlet's go ahead and do it in the lab we\\nare going to go ahead and create a Pages\\nfolder then I'm going to take cart page\\ndrag it in pages\\nthen I'll may let extension dot make the\\nchanges and save those changes\\nthen I'll put home page as well\\nthen we are done with that let's save it\\nafter that we need another folder and we\\nare going to name it widgets this is\\ngoing to contain small widgets not\\nexactly pages but smaller widgets so\\nwe'll pass in the product card let's\\nmove it in\\nand let's save the changes and one thing\\nI forgot to do was put product Details\\npage in pages so let's put it there\\nsave it and then the last thing is I\\nthink provide a product list and product\\nlist also goes in the pages\\nso we have widgets and pages so this is\\ngood for a smaller application then in\\nthe lip folder I'm also going to create\\nproviders and as our app skills we are\\ngoing to have more providers right\\nso we are going to create a separate\\nproviders where all the providers are\\ngoing to stay like cart provider also\\nsave those changes if you don't save it\\nit will give error in your app so we\\nhave Pages provider widgets and Global\\nvariables can stay here\\nor you can create a utils folder and\\nsave it in utility but I don't like to\\ndo that utility includes some other\\nthings not exactly Global variables\\nGlobal variables can be constants\\nor something else all right so we have a\\ncleaner folder structure here\\nthe purpose of a clean folder structure\\nis that you can\\njust have your apps layout very nicely\\nand more Engineers working on it will be\\na better thing all right and even the\\nChrome is now set up so if you come over\\nhere and expand the app there is Chrome\\nand this looks decent enough not bad not\\ngood\\nif we come to the product list over here\\nwe are getting an error and this error\\nis there because it wasn't able to find\\nsomething we just need to restart\\nbecause this happened when we were\\nchanging the folders right now if you\\ncome over here the error is gone perfect\\nso what are the changes we need to make\\nwell the first change as you can see in\\nthe details men's Nike shoes\\nthis shoe image is quite big I want to\\nreduce the shoe image size and that's\\nnot just for one shoe even this shoe is\\nquite big\\nso let's go to the product Details page\\nand scroll down we'll find our\\nimage.asset and as you can see this\\nerror is there because we haven't set a\\nparticular height for it and what should\\nthe height be well let's go ahead and\\nsee it the height should be 250 let's\\nsay if we do that come over here\\nthis shows up nicely and if we go to the\\niOS device\\nover here and we click on it we have 250\\nshowing up this looks cool it works on\\nboth the screen sizes\\nlet's click over here and yeah this\\nlooks cool I'm fine with it also if you\\nright click on Chrome\\nclick on inspect you'll be clicking on\\nthis icon over here to toggle device\\ntoolbar and now you can check for the\\nresponsive design from here itself right\\nand as you can see when we increase the\\nfont size the maximum height it takes is\\nwhat we've mentioned over here 250 and\\nwhen we shrink the size the image height\\nkeeps on decreasing so that's a good\\nthing for us right\\neven for our button if you see that's\\nthe case the button keeps on increasing\\nand it takes the entire width of the\\nscreen\\nwith the padding there now I don't want\\nthis what I want is the button to only\\nbe there\\nonly this much\\njust like our\\nshoe all right so it shouldn't be this\\nbig because it looks kind of weird\\ndoesn't it so we can scroll down to our\\nbutton and here you see we have set up\\nthe minimum size how this works is it\\nthe minimum size it can take is double\\ndot infinity and then we've wrapped it\\nwith padding\\nso they're spacing over here\\nhowever what we can see here is maximum\\nsize can be this much\\nthen when we click\\nyou see this is quite small because the\\nmaximum size it can take is this so we\\nhave set up a constraint over here that\\nmaximum size is this much minimum size\\ncan be whatever you\\nhave the child as how much ever size the\\nchild requires and same happens over\\nhere although I'm pleased with the\\nresult this is not what we want so we\\nare going to use fixed size over here\\nbecause maximum size gives us\\na very small result minimum size gives\\nus a very big result\\nfixed size will give us exactly what we\\nwant so instead of passing in double dot\\nInfinity I'll pass 250\\nthis is good enough and if I pass 350\\nCome Away\\nyou see this looks good enough\\nthe problem then comes on the pixel\\nemulator all right if we just open it\\nand take a look if it looks good enough\\nlet's run it without debugging if it\\nworks well on the pixel emulator then\\nwe're fine with that it all looks good\\nbut if it doesn't then something needs\\nto change\\nand we have the pixel emulator\\nif I click on a product add to cart is\\nthere and it's similar to this thing\\nover here perfect I like it this way so\\nthis works well on the\\nscreens on all the screens in fact so we\\nare done with the product detail screen\\nthe selecting part is still the same we\\ncan add to cart we can go back come to\\nthe shopping cart and we'll see our\\nproduct\\nand here if I click on delete delete\\nproduct everything looks good it's all\\ngood in my opinion you know the dialogue\\ntakes only this much space which is what\\nI want\\nthen\\nthis is the size that I want I only\\nwanted this much so everything looks\\ngood over here but the problem I have\\nright now is this card over here this\\ncard takes in a lot of width and this\\nwidth is fine over here this width is\\ncompletely perfect but over here it's\\ntaking in a lot of width what I want to\\ndo instead is if we exceed a certain\\nscreen size or screen width let's\\ninspect the tab and come over here so if\\nI reach let's say this much height\\nlet's say this much height\\nthen I\\nautomatically want to show double cards\\nso I want two cards to be displaying on\\nthe single screen\\nand when we are less than that\\nparticular dimension\\nI want only one card to display so it\\ndepends on what the screen size is\\nagain just to tell you if I expand this\\nI want two cards but when I have it\\nminimized like it's in a phone mode I\\nwant it this long I only want one card\\nto be present otherwise two cards so how\\ncan I make this happen that's where we\\nhave another widget in place frada gives\\nit to us what is that\\nif we just come to the home page and in\\nthe home page we have to go to the\\nproduct list\\nin the list view Builder\\nnow this listview Builder this list view\\nBuilder is for filters and filters look\\ngreat\\nthis is the thing I'm worried about this\\nlist view Builder over here\\nnow instead of returning one list over\\nhere\\nI'm going to have grids and it depends\\non the screen size right\\nso how do I calculate the device width\\nso for that particular reason we have\\nfinal\\nsize which is equal to Media query\\nthis media query gives us a lot of\\nthings it will give us what platform we\\nare on what is our screen height what is\\nour screen size what is our screen width\\nwhat mode are we on so like if the phone\\nis in a straight mode or if it is in a\\nhorizontal mode like this it will give\\nus all of that data\\nso it's pretty helpful for us yes you\\ncan click over here to change the mode\\nof the app or mode of the phone\\nif it's portrait mode or horizontal mode\\nwhatever\\nso media query gives us access to all of\\nthat so what I want is mediaquery dot\\noff context dot size you can see over\\nhere it gives us a lot many more things\\nlike view padding View and such platform\\nbrightness and you can look at all the\\nthings it gives us but what I want is\\nsize why because size will give me the\\nperfect size and then it will give me\\nthe size of the media and logical pixels\\nexample the size of the screen that's\\nwhat I want\\nand also you'll see away a media query\\ndot off context and if you see over here\\nfor the media query itself it extends\\nsomething known as inherited model not\\ninherited widget a narrated model is\\nkind of like inherited widget but\\nthere is a slight difference we are\\ngoing to talk about\\nlet me just\\ntell you how this works how we can make\\ntwo cards appear on a bigger screen and\\nonly one card on a smaller screen and\\nthen we can talk about the difference\\nbetween inherited model and inherited\\nwidget\\nand how it affects us\\nso we'll scroll down and here where our\\nlist view Builder is there expanded is\\nthere in the child\\nso first of all let me make it clear\\nthat whenever we want to display two\\nitems\\nin\\nkind of like a grid what we use is grid\\nview Builder so just like listview\\nBuilder there's grid view Builder and\\nobviously there is grid view as well\\nwhich you can use\\nbut great view Builder is used when you\\ndon't know the number of items the grid\\nis going to have in our case products\\ndot length is the number of items in\\nGrid View and list view both as of right\\nnow we know what the products length is\\nbut if we make database connections and\\nwe dynamically get it from the database\\nwe won't know how many products are\\nthere just think of Amazon does Amazon\\nknow how many products there are they\\nare like billion products they can't\\npossibly know how many exact items or\\nproducts are there\\nthat's why there is item Builder and\\ngrid view Builder widgets\\nso we are going to use grid view Builder\\nand just to give you a demonstration I'm\\ngoing to comment this out I'm only going\\nto have expanded again because this ba\\nis similar to listview Builder it will\\ntake in the\\nentire height of the screen but it\\ndoesn't have the entire height\\nso we have to wrap it with expanded then\\nwe are going to have grid view Builder\\nthis requires grid delegate and then it\\nrequires sliver grid delegate this grid\\ndelegate controls the layout of the\\nchildren so this will tell it how many\\nitems we want in a row how many\\nitems should have how much spacing so\\nall of that configurations can be made\\nwith sliver grid delegate so let's type\\nit out sliver grid delegate but then it\\nis an abstract class abstract classes\\nare made so that we can use their\\nsubtypes which follows a particular\\nattribute for example get layout and\\nshould relay relay out\\nshould be followed by every class that\\nextends or implements sliver grid\\ndelegate that's why abstract classes are\\nmade and your abstract classes are\\nallowed\\nhere I can pass in anything sliver grid\\ndelegate related for example sliver grid\\ndelegate with fixed cross access count\\nsliver grid delegate with fixed with Max\\ncross access counts level Grid delegate\\nwith fixed cross access so all of that\\nis present aware what we want is sliver\\ngrid delegate with fixed cross access\\ncount\\nhere we get an error but this error is\\nnot because this is an abstract class\\nthis isn't\\nthis is a normal class but requires a\\nnamed argument but before jumping into\\nthat let's format it and understand what\\nthis means sliver grid delegate with\\nfixed cross access count we know what\\nsliver grid delegate is it's this thing\\nthat it requires to control the layout\\nof our children\\nin the grid view Builder obviously\\nwith fixed cross access count basically\\nmeans how many items you want in one row\\nin the product list or in the grid view\\nBuilder\\nand how many do we want to display in\\none particular row I want to display\\nlet's say two widgets at the most\\nso here we have to pass in a required\\nargument of cross access count which\\nwill be 2.\\nnow consider grid view as a column right\\nall the widgets are going to be one\\nbelow another so consider it a column by\\npassing in Cross access you're basically\\nmentioning everything in a row format\\nthat's what column does right when you\\npass in Cross access alignment you pass\\nin the alignment in horizontal Direction\\nthat's what we are doing here so let's\\nput Constable error then we are going to\\nhave context index just like we had with\\nlist View\\nand then we want the exact same thing\\nthat we had over here so let's go ahead\\nand uncomment this\\nwe can copy this gesture detector and\\nreturn it over here\\nthen again we can comment the list view\\nBuilder I only uncommented because I\\nwanted to copy stuff now it requires\\nproduct\\nwhat is the product well first of all we\\nhave to mention the item count even grid\\nview Builder has the same thing item\\ncount so let's go ahead pass in products\\ndot length and product is going to be\\nfinal product\\nis equal to\\nproducts at index\\ngreat all the errors are now gone the\\nwarning is up there over here and it's\\nthere because of the size variable that\\nwe've never used we're going to use it\\nin just a moment after we understand how\\ngrid view Builder works now let's\\nrestart become aware and we see two\\nproducts displaying in a grid format\\nperfect\\nnow if you come over here\\nwe have the same thing displaying but\\nthis error here is Justified because it\\njust looks so awful on a mobile screen\\nhowever this looks cool enough over here\\nright two products and this looks better\\nhowever we have a problem over here we\\nare going to fix that problem but first\\nof all we just want to configure the\\nlayout such that on smaller screen sizes\\nwe use a list view Builder otherwise a\\ngrid view Builder\\nso it's very simple we just want to get\\nthe device size\\nand that device size should not exceed\\n600 or 650 which is what the normal\\ndevices\\nsize is\\nand then accordingly we can display a\\ngrid view Builder so basically\\nwe want to check if the device width is\\ngreater than 650 if it is greater than 6\\nwith 50 that means we want a grid view\\nBuilder because it's a bigger screen\\nsize however if we are less than 650\\nscreen width then we want to display a\\nlist view Builder because it's a smaller\\nscreen size so we can take the size\\nthen\\nwe can uncomment this line\\nand then have our if condition laid out\\nwhat is the rift condition\\nit's a ternary operator we are just\\ngoing to have size dot width so with\\nsize dot width I get access to the\\ndevice width this is not the width of\\nany widget or any constraints\\nit doesn't follow any constraints of\\npadding or whatever it just gives us the\\nentire device width so here I'm just\\nchecking if size dot width is greater\\nthan\\n650 then I want list view Builder or\\ngrid view Builder sorry so I'll copy\\ngrid view Builder\\ncut it also remove expanded from here\\nbecause expanded is already there at the\\ntop and then we are going to have grid\\nview Builder like this\\notherwise we are going to display a list\\nview Builder\\nso if size dot width is greater than 650\\nwe show a grid view Builder otherwise a\\nlist view Builder works so a grid view\\nBuilder is still shown here however a\\nlist view Builder is shown here that's\\nperfect exactly what I wanted\\nso this is where media query can help us\\nmedia query can also help us to size the\\nwidgets\\naccording to what we want if we want\\nthis widget size to be bigger it can be\\nbigger if we want it to be smaller it\\ncan be smaller\\nnow let's come over here and try to fix\\nthis\\ndevice height why are we getting such a\\nbig device height over here\\nso why is this thing over here exceeding\\nto understand that we must first analyze\\non a smaller screen on a smaller screen\\nthis looks good it's perfect exactly the\\nway I wanted it so there's definitely no\\nissue in the product card otherwise you\\nmight think hey product card is taking\\ntoo much height no we have not\\nexplicitly set any height for our\\nproduct card for our container and\\nthat's how it should be\\nfirst you should never mention the\\nheight\\nyou should always try to use flexible\\nexpanded all of those widgets whenever\\nyou're using you shouldn't specifically\\ngo ahead and type hey I want to use this\\nheight when things become uncontrollable\\nby expanded double dot Infinity all of\\nthose stuff then you need to explicitly\\nmention a height just like we did with\\nthe add to cart button\\nI'll summarize this at the end but as of\\nright now no we are not going to\\nchange the height in the product card\\nbecause it's all good it is taking as\\nmuch height as it should on a list view\\nBuilder but it's not doing the same on\\ngrid view Builder so there's a problem\\nwith grid view Builder and what is the\\nproblem\\nyou can Google it but if I have to tell\\nyou the problem is this child aspect\\nratio over here the child aspect ratio\\nis the ratio of\\nmay cross axis extend to main access\\nextent and that is one meaning cross\\naccess extent is this big then main\\naccess extent should also be this big\\nthey should have a ratio of one so cross\\naxis extend divided by main axis extent\\nshould be one that means both should be\\nthe same value and that's why it's\\nexceeding but in our case we don't want\\nthat if both have the same height and\\nwidth that means it is a square and\\nclearly we don't have a square over here\\nit's a rectangle\\nso we can edit the value here and set\\nchild aspect ratio to let's say 1.5 save\\nit and you see\\nit becomes shorter but still not enough\\nI still want it shorter so maybe I can\\ngo till 1.75\\nand you might be satisfied with it\\nbut I'm not I can say child aspect ratio\\nto True 2 and this looks good in my\\nopinion it looks brilliant\\nso I hope you understood it we made it\\nsuch that the main\\nsuch that the cross access extent is\\ndouble the size or extent of main access\\nextent\\njust think about it\\nchild aspect ratio is equal to cross\\naxis upon main axis\\nif cross axis is 100\\nthen 100 divided by 50 will give us 2.\\nso cross axis is double the extent of\\nmain axis\\nso on Cross access you see it's this big\\nit's this big it's double the extent of\\nthis mean axis\\nall right\\nso we have fixed the error over here and\\nthis looks much better and it does feel\\nlike a web app which is perfectly laid\\nout so yeah we have this and everything\\nabout it looks good\\nso I'm satisfied with what we have over\\nhere in terms of responsive design\\nso this was about the media query and\\nthe power of media query media query\\nshould always be used whenever you want\\nto get the size of the screen the device\\nwidth or device height of the screen\\nand to talk about the difference between\\ninherited model and inherited widget by\\nextending inherited model you can listen\\nto one particular\\nproperty all right so in inherited\\nwidget let's say media query dot off\\ncontext is called\\nand let's say the value of device pixel\\nratio changed let's just assume okay the\\nvalue of device pixel ratio changed\\nbut in our app we are using\\nmediaquery.off context dot size\\nso in reality the value of device pixel\\nratio changed but this will still get\\ncalled the build function will still\\nrebuild because that's what inherited\\nmodel or inherited widget do whenever\\nthere's a change\\nthey will rebuild the entire build build\\nfunction and if they do that\\nunnecessarily my widgets are getting\\ncalled\\nso this is what happens in inherited\\nwidget\\nyou can't listen to one particular\\nproperty in inherited widget your in\\ngeneral listening to any changes in\\nmedia dot mediaquery dot off context and\\nthen you're just saying that give me the\\nsize it's fine\\nbut if device pixel ratio changes this\\nbuild function will get rebuilt for no\\nreason at all because the size didn't\\nchange the pixel device ratio changed\\nso this is just an example I'm not\\nsaying pixel device ratio will change\\nand that will happen no nothing like\\nthat will happen\\nbut I'm just telling you and if\\ncondition or an edge case that can\\nhappen and this happens in inherited\\nwidget with inherited model what you can\\ndo is Media query dot size of context or\\nyou can do media query Dot\\ndevice pixel ratio of context with this\\nwhat you've done is you're just\\nlistening to one particular property\\nyou're just listening to the size\\nchanges of the device\\nyou're not listening to anything else at\\nall you're not listening to the changes\\nin device pixel ratio you're not\\nchanging you're not listening to changes\\nin some other property in media query\\nyou're just listening to the changes in\\nsize so this is what inherited model\\ndoes inherited model will help you\\nselect one feature to listen to or one\\nproperty to listen to inherited widget\\nlistens to everything entire class all\\nright so that was the difference and\\nhere I am using size of context because\\nI only want to listen to the size\\ncool now if I restart it will look the\\nsame thing so now that we've talked\\nabout media query I also want to cover\\nOne widget which is very helpful and I\\nuse it all the time when I want to make\\nmy layouts and that is the layout\\nbuildup widget\\nso I'll remove media query from here\\nbecause it's\\ndifferent from media query but\\nin this case it is going to replace\\nmedia query\\nso let's comment this thing out\\nokay\\nand what is this layout Builder widget\\nso first I'm just going to type the code\\nout then I'll explain what this layout\\nBuilder widget does\\nso\\nfor layout Builder widget I'm just going\\nto have layout Builder like this Builder\\nwhich will give me context\\nand something known as box constraints\\nall right now we'll figure out what this\\nbox constraints is what this box\\nconstraints is is it gives us a bunch of\\nconstraints which we need to follow to\\nlay out our app\\nso if I just print stuff constraints\\nDot and let's say Max height which is\\nthe main\\nthing then we have Max\\nwidth then we have minimum height and\\nminimum width\\nall right and then we are going to\\nreturn a text from your let's say and\\nthat just says hello\\nso nothing to fancy here and we see a\\nhello nothing else a very simple text is\\nreturned and you might think there is no\\npurpose of layout Builder but when you\\nopen the terminal you'll see\\nconstraints dot Max height over here is\\ninfinity constraints dot Max height\\nagain I don't know why we haven't\\nchanged it we want maximum width\\nthen minimum height and minimum width\\nall right\\nnow we can restart again and we see over\\nhere Max height is infinity\\nMax width is 1440\\nand minimum height and minimum width is\\nzero what is this giving us well layout\\nBuilder gives us the constraints in\\nwhich it is for example a certain widget\\nmight impose some constraint on us right\\nlet's say layout Builder is wrapped with\\na widget which is size box and has a\\nheight of 100 width of 200 let's save it\\nwe restart the app here you see the\\nconstraints have changed now the max\\nheight is 100 Max width is 200 minimum\\nheight is 100 and minimum width is 200\\nmeaning minimum and maximum width is 200\\nwhat we have specified over here and\\nmaximum and minimum height is 100 what\\nwe have specified over here\\nso what layout Builder does is it gets\\nits constraints from the parent widgets\\nso whatever which constrains the parent\\nwidgets give it\\nit has those in its mind and it will\\ntell us about those constraints that's\\nwhy earlier when we didn't have any\\nconstraint at all it gave us Infinity\\nbecause it can take how muchever space\\nit requires then we add maximum width\\nthe maximum width would be the width of\\nthis device and it is one four four zero\\nyou can check it for M1 Max\\nand then the minimum I hit and minimum\\nwidth can be zero so you can make sure\\nthat your\\nwidget returned from your can be of\\nheightened with 0 or it can be any\\nheight or a width till one four four\\nzero so it gives you certain set of\\nconstraints According to which you need\\nto follow\\nso that's what layout Builder does\\nit cares about what restrictions are put\\non it\\nwhat constraints the container size box\\npadding widget give to it so here we are\\njust going to take this constraints to\\nknow what is the height and the width\\nall right\\nso we are just going to have if\\nconstraints dot maximum width is greater\\nthan 650\\nso since it is a builder it is a\\nfunction at the end of the day we want\\nto return a widget but I'm putting an if\\ncondition over here\\nand since this is a function I can put\\nan if condition like this if we were in\\nUI I would put if condition like this\\nand there would be no braces all right\\nbut we are not in UI we are in a build\\nof function and in function\\nI have to put a curly bracket because\\nthat's what DART requires anyways if the\\nconstraints.max width is greater than\\n650 then I want to show a grid view\\nBuilder\\nso let's return grid view Builder make\\nsure to return it\\nand as you can see when I save it it\\ndoesn't format it automatically the core\\nformatting doesn't work because there's\\nan error and this error is there because\\nwe have one if condition in place so if\\nconstraints dot Max width is greater\\nthan 650 then we return a grid view\\nBuilder okay but what if it is not\\ngreater than 650 like our iPhone what\\nshould we do in that case then we will\\nhave an else condition and there we are\\ngoing to return a list view Builder so\\nlet's copy this\\nthen we are going to return\\na list view Builder sweet Also let's Pro\\nremove one pattern thesis make sure\\neverything is correct over here let's\\nrestart the apps on iPhone Chrome and\\neverything\\nand we see an error over here and the\\nsame error over here\\nthat error is there because render\\nviewport and we have some boxing related\\nproblems\\nso basically what we need to do\\nis remove the expanded from grid view\\nBuilder\\nand we've already removed the expander\\nfrom list view Builder\\nthen we are going to wrap\\nthe widget with expanded right now if we\\nsave it everything shows up correctly\\nand even here everything shows up\\ncorrectly\\nso expanded says take as much space and\\nwidth as you require so here if we try\\nto print constraints dot Max height\\nand if we try to print constraints dot\\nMax width we should be seeing a value\\nlet's restart we see 535 and 430 for\\niPhone and when we go to Chrome\\nand restart we see 570. now the max\\nheight instead of infinity it is 570\\nbecause that's how much space it is\\ngetting because that's what expanded\\ndoes right I hope you got a better\\nunderstanding of it through layout\\nBuilder\\nand as the name suggests it helps you to\\nbuild layouts\\nand the max width doesn't change because\\nthere is no constraint or there's\\nnothing over here\\nhowever Max height did change\\nso yeah\\nwe just need to wrap expanded to layout\\nBuilder then we return a grid view\\nBuilder without expanded because\\nexpanded is there for our layout Builder\\nwe are getting the constraints properly\\nnow and the same goes for listview build\\nup you're getting our constraints\\nproperly set up so this is layout\\nBuilder now you might ask what is the\\ndifference between media query and\\nlayout Builder the difference is Media\\nquery takes the entire device width and\\nthe entire device size no matter what\\nthe restrictions on the widget are but\\nlayout Builder takes width and height\\nbased on the restrictions imposed by the\\nparent widgets on it and that's why I'll\\nlikely out build a better because you\\nalways want to build your widgets based\\non what the parent gives you whatever\\nsizing the parent will give you you need\\nto follow that if media query doesn't\\nobey that then it's a problem\\nbut if layout Builder\\nis telling you some constraints it it's\\nbecause of the parent constraints and we\\nneed to follow that for example if I\\ncome over here add to cart button let's\\nsay has some restrictions imposed by its\\nparent widget I shouldn't be using media\\nquery dot size of context or media\\nquery.off context dot size because then\\nI'll be taking the entire width of the\\nscreen\\nI only want to take as much width and as\\nmuch height as my parent allows me to do\\nthat's why layout Builder is\\nused more often in my code I don't use\\nmedia query that often\\nin certain cases yes you do want the\\nscreen width but in this case layout\\nBuilder works fine so we are using\\nlayout Builder I also hope you\\nunderstood the Box constraints here it\\ngives you the constraints you can have\\nfor your\\nwidgets that you want to return and you\\ncan check based on that also when you\\nprint stuff here\\nlike Max height and Max with press\\ncommand J\\nrestart we get 517 and 1440 then I'll\\nclick on inspect\\nand then you see\\nthe layout changed the height is still\\nthe same but the width decreased\\nso this is what I wanted to show to you\\nand then we are getting an error over\\nhere\\nsaying that hey this is not enough\\nso maybe we do need to set the child\\naspect ratio at 1.75\\nand then it will work on all the screen\\nsizes\\nI think it works till 1080 so we can\\npush it till 1080 so if constraints dot\\nMax width is greater than 1080 width\\nso if you have this we have two cards\\nshowing up otherwise just one card okay\\nso this works better I guess and as you\\ncan see when I increase\\nthis card also increases right if you\\njust\\ncome over here a little bit over here\\nyou see the device or the card is\\nshrinking in\\nits\\nheight and width but when I increase the\\nwidth of the device it increases as well\\nso this is the beauty of child aspect\\nratio you can configure it the way you\\nwant it to work I think greater than\\n1080 is fine because all laptops have a\\nwidth greater than 1080 at least I'm\\nhoping that so yeah this was about\\nlayout Builder and this is how it's\\ndifferent from media query\\nnow you can play around with it and make\\nthe weather app\\nresponsive as well I didn't make it\\nresponsive for this particular reason I\\nwanted to teach over here where we would\\nhave better examples and then I would\\nask you to do it for weather app and\\nsend me the code if you want me to\\nreview it I'll review it for you\\nso this was all about responsive UI that\\nI wanted to share so to sum it up for\\nyou try not to size your widgets because\\nmost widgets don't need an explicit size\\ngiven to it they don't need sizes like\\n350 300 250 given to it they can take up\\nthe space they need if you have a widget\\nlike list view Builder which needs the\\nentire device height then you can use\\nwidgets like expanded to give it all the\\navailable space\\nand expanded is generally used in a\\ncolumn widget or a row widget if your\\nwidget does need a size however then\\ngive it a height of let's say 40 100 150\\n200 whatever\\nbecause this height is in logical pixels\\nand logical pixels basically promise\\nthat your widget will have the same\\nphysical size on all devices so this\\nmeans if your widget has a size of your\\nthumb on one of your device then it will\\nhave the size of your thumb on all\\ndevices\\nand the third option is to use a layout\\nBuilder or media query and I've already\\nexplained the difference between both of\\nthem to you so this marks the end of the\\nflutter beginners course we've covered a\\nlot in this course but there's a lot\\nmore to learn I wasn't able to cover all\\nthe widgets as there are more than 200\\nto 300 widgets and flutter the point\\nisn't to know about all the widgets it's\\nabout understanding how widgets should\\nbe laid out how State Management and the\\nflutter framework work if you've\\nunderstood that you're ready to build\\napps on your own if you want to know\\nmore about databases you can watch\\nInstagram or Reddit clone tutorials\\npresent on this channel so I hope you've\\nmastered the basics in flutter and you\\nfound some value in this tutorial thank\\nyou so much for watching and I'll see\\nyou in the next video\""

              "\"in this course we are going to learn to. build apps for multiple platforms like. Android iOS web and desktop from a. single code base using the flutter. framework this course is designed for. absolute beginners infiniter however I. highly recommend you to watch the dart. beginners course present on the channel. as this course requires a strong. understanding of Dart this course solely. focuses on flutter app development and. does not cover any database related. topics we'll create three apps in this. course first one is a simple currency. converter app to get started second is. the weather app where all the weather. data is being fetched from the web and. the last one is a shopping app. by building these three apps we learn. various aspects of flutter such as. widgets layouts responsive layouts State. Management. Etc. additionally I'll provide you with a. brief overview of the inner workings of. flutter like understanding how flutter. handles rendering State Management and. more behind the scene stuff I've covered. database related topics in separate. tutorials which you can easily follow. along after watching this tutorial. before starting this course I'd like to. thank RF Islam for providing me with the. UI of the shop app and Tomic reader and. Ismail Alam Khan for helping me set up. the curriculum of this course now let's. get started by installing flutter so to. install flutter you need to make sure. you're on this website flutter.dev then. you can click on docs install flutter. and then you'll see a bunch of options. to select the operating system on which. you want to install flutter so if you. are on Windows or Linux you can click. either of them and if you're on Mac you. can click on Mac OS now I won't be able. to cover the windows and Linux. installation processes because I don't. have either of those systems. however there's one thing I'd like to. mention that if you just click over here. you'll get the entire installation. process and most of it is similar to the. installation process on Mac OS so we. need to get the flutter SDK we need to. do the Android setup and if there's. anything we can do the Windows setup as. well but one thing you need to do. additional is install git if you haven't. already so for flutter you need to have. git pre-installed in your system so you. can click on open a new tab and download. the get installer from here depending on. your system you can either install this. 32-bit or this which is 64-bit after you. have the installer you can double click. on it and run it then follow all the. processes the wizard gives you and then. you'll have get installed in your system. to check if it is installed or not you. can go to your system and just type get. if you see something like this it means. get us installed. if it isn't then you haven't installed. it properly you need to make sure that. it's installed properly all right so. let's clear this off and. one last thing to mention over here is. when you have the Windows installation. process you cannot do iOS setup because. you cannot build apps for iOS from a. Windows machine you can only build apps. for Android web and windows from a. Windows operating system you can build. for Android web and Linux from a Linux. operating system but you cannot build. for iOS or Mac OS from Windows or Linux. so that's a point to know that's why if. you see a wire you don't have IOS setup. written over here. however if you come to Windows or Mac OS. installation you'll see iOS setup here. we have xcode which already includes get. which means we don't have to install git. separately on Mac all right you can see. it away flutter users get for. installation and upgrade we recommend. installing xcode which includes get but. you can also you install git separately. all right so we are just going to. install it with xcode I already have it. installed it doesn't make any difference. but if you don't have git installed. we'll install it when we install xq so. now let's dive into this so the first. part is to get the flutter SDK. so to get the flutter SDK depending on. what Mac you have Intel Mac or apple. silicon Mac you can select either of. these buttons. since I am on an M1 chip I'm just going. to click over here and it will start the. installation process for me on Windows. also the first part is to get the. flutter SDK you'll get only one button. to install the flutter SDK on Windows. after that you need to extract the file. in the desired location. so you need to make sure one particular. folder where you can install it for me I. already know where I want to do it so if. I go to found finder press command shift. G. then just a forward slash so I go to. Macintosh HD. put it in a grid format so that it's. better to see. where I want to install flutter is users. driven ranavat and over here all right. so from the root of my laptop I want to. go to users everyone ranavat and here. I'll have the flutter. folder or extract so once the. installation is complete which I think. is complete I'll drag it over here so. I'll just open a new finder which has. downloads. I'll have flutter over here I'll drag it. over here in my advantra now with folder. and there we have flutter right here. cool now the next step is to add the. flutter tool to our path now we can just. copy this Command put it in the terminal. and run it and then we'll be able to use. flutter specific commands like flutter. doctor. but now you can see flutter command is. not find because I've not run this. command and if I run this command. meaning I add flutter tool to my path. then run it so it will locate flutter. doctor so it will know what flutter. command is but when I exit the terminal. reopen the terminal again it will forget. the flutter command because it only sets. the path for the current terminal window. it doesn't set it for the entire. terminal or for the entire system. it only does for one window. so to permanently add it we have to. click a wire which is permanently. updating a path and follow the steps. written over here. so the first step is to determine the. path of our clone of the flutter SDK. so we already know where it is from the. root of our folder we need to go to the. users. flutter bin so this is our path all. right then we need to open or create the. RC file for your shell then we need to. type this command in the terminal so. let's go ahead and copy it. so we have slash bin slash zsh. typing this command gives us access to. what shell we are using IV using bash or. are we using search shell since it gives. us the output as zsh it means we are. using that shell so I need to edit this. part right here okay so I'll just copy. it then over here I'm going to type Vim. which is kind of like a code editor so. if I just put them. like this I'll be able to edit out zshrc. file right here in the Vim code editor I. can also type Nano. instead of Vim followed by dollar home. slash Dot zshrc and that will open it in. Nano but I'm more comfortable with whim. so I'm going to go ahead and use it. now the final step is to copy this line. and paste it over here so here we need. to mention the path of the flutter get. directory where is it it's in users. so we can. backspace over here but when I try to. backspace you see I just go in the left. hand side it's not actually deleting. anything so to delete it we have to. press X so it will start erasing stuff. then you can backspace everything and. paste this line right here all right so. we have export path is equal to. double inverted comma dollar path colon. slash user slash this is where we have. stored right slash user slasher and run. out slash flutter. slash bin all right then. that's pretty much it now we can press. enter. then we can have colon W click on enter. that saves the file then we'll have. colon queue a and we exert them like. this. now if we run the command again you'll. see we have this line written right over. here that's good so it has saved it. successfully and we have successfully. added it to our path as well now we need. to run this command so that we refresh. the current window to see our you know. changes if flutter command is working or. not or we can just open a new terminal. window so I'm just going to close this. I'm going to create a new terminal and. then I need to run this command to. verify that the flutter path. flutter bin directory is now in our path. so we can run this and we see users. rewind out flutter bin that's great now. I can clear this off now I need to. verify if the flutter command is working. or not so I'll copy this paste it over. here and there we go. this gives us the location of our. flutter folder. this is where it's located right users. flutter bin flutter right this thing. right here. so we have successfully installed. flutter to our system if you're on. Windows. after updating your path which is. mentioned in the documentation you. should be able to run which flutter. command and see the correct output if. you do that means flutter installed. successfully now we can just run the. flutter doctor command which gives us a. list of things now that we need to focus. on and flutterdoctor gives me a list of. things so it's kind of like a real. doctor it tells you what all is not. there what all is missing and this is. what you need to do so Shredder is. installed we are on 3.10.5 which is the. latest version as of June 21. now the. next step is to install Android related. stuff you can see that over here android. setup. then we need to work on xcode so we. develop for iOS and Mac OS. and after that you know we are basically. done with everything Android Studio is. related to Android related stuff so. we'll have all of those working so let's. get to the Android setup not wasting any. more time and just start installing. Android Studio as well. so Android Studio is helping us to build. native Android applications so you can. use Scotland. or Java. and start preparing your apps in Android. Studio as well so we need to install. this as well so we'll just open it in a. new tab. and we'll click on download Android. Studio we have read the terms and. conditions and we have the Apple chip so. we'll select that now we'll wait for. Android Studio to install properly and. after that we need to start Android. Studio go through the Android setup. wizard. this will install the latest Android SDK. Android SDK command line tools and. Android SDK build tools which are. required by flutter When developing for. Android. so after we do all of that we again run. flutterdoctor and we see if there's a. tick mark over here because we've. installed Android Studio so Android. Studio is installed successfully let's. double click on this TMG file let's. transfer it to Applications. and Android Studio is transferred to. applications now we can also put this. installer in bin if you want you can. also go ahead and put this in bin which. is another installer. then we can go to Applications. let's go to Android Studio double click. over here. then it asks us if it is downloaded from. internet and if we trust it so you just. click on open again. we are not going to import any Android. Studio settings so we'll just click on. OK. maybe we can send usage statistics to. Google we can click on next. choose the type of setup you want for. Android so we have not installed. anything earlier so we'll just go ahead. with the standard one. we'll click on next. select the UI theme you want let's go. ahead with docula. then these are the extra things that. will install emulator build tools all of. that stuff we'll click on next. then live sensors for everything we'll. click on accept. we'll come over here. except for this one as well then we'll. click on finish it will start. downloading the components for this so. all the components have now been. installed we can click on finish and we. have Android studio right here. we don't want to do anything with that. we are just going to close it we'll. close this as well now let's again run. flutter doctor and see if there's. anything we're missing now as you can. see over here Android Studio is already. installed now so that was successful Now. Android related stuff two things are. required we need the command line tools. component so for that we are again going. to run Android Studio. then we are going to go to more actions. SDK manager. then we are going to search for SDK. tools. then we have Android SDK command line. tools right here we'll click over there. and then click on OK click on okay over. here that will install it and we are. done. so we can close this let's again run. flutterdoctor command. and you see that issue is resolved now. we now only need to accept the Android. licenses that we haven't so we can run. this command and it will do that we just. need to put it in the same line and run. it and then it works all right so. yeah we'll review the licenses that have. not been accepted then we'll click yes. yes yes yes. and there we go so we have been accepted. all the licenses so I hope everything is. working fine for Android now so we'll. run flutter doctor and everything. related to Android is also fixed now now. the last step is xcode developed for iOS. and Mac OS. so the final step that's required is for. xcode so we need to develop for iOS and. Mac OS we can do that by going to the. App Store and installing xcode or just. go into the web download I'll go to the. App Store and install it. so I'll wait for xcode to install and. then we can focus on the stuff that's. mentioned later on so I'll see you when. xcode is installed completely on the. system all right so xcode has installed. on our system I'll just click on open. here so we like to build for Mac OS and. iOS so I'm just going to click on. install here I'll have to enter my. password and then it will start. installing additional components after. that we need to configure the xcode. command lines tools to use the newly. installed version of xcode so we can. just copy this line. then click on enter again we'll have to. enter a password over here and we are. done then we can again run this command. paste it. so this is great I think we've. configured xcode for now. one last command is left which is this. pseudo xcode build license. we'll. press space for more. and then we just need to type agree to. say that we are agreeing and we are done. now we can clear this off run flutter. doctor and see if it is done properly or. not. so one issue from xcode is gone now we. just need to install cocoapod which is. not installed so to install it we can. just go to their guide the link that is. mentioned over here. paste it. and to install Coco pod we just need to. run this command sudogem install. cocoapods. so we have installed cocoapods now we. can again run the flutterdoctor command. and as you can see no issues found that. means the entire flutter installation is. successful so if you've covered this. part and everything works fine it's all. good now the last step. is to install vs code. so if you just type in vs code install. you'll see this website. code.visualstudio.com so this is. basically our code editor this is where. we are going to write our code type it. all out in the dart course we had used. dotpad.dev now we don't need to use that. anymore. we're going to write on our system only. so we are going to use our PC. and here we have Visual Studio code that. will help us to you know. debug writer code it will help us and. basically everything. so you can install it according to your. platform again I'm just going to go. ahead with the Apple silicon zip file. and it will start installing it for me. after I have vs code installed I'll just. start creating a flutter project and. we'll create a first app that is the. currency converter app so vs code is now. installed you can see it and downloads. I'm just going to click on the small. search icon over here. so it shows that Visual Studio code is. in the download I'm just going to drag. this to the applications tab because vs. code is an application then double click. on it. then click on open. and we have vs code right here I'm going. to browse the color themes and select. which one I prefer I don't prefer the. dark high contrast it looks very weird. in my opinion. obviously not. light modern color we can use this one. or you can go ahead look for more themes. so now that we have Visual Studio code. installed let's go ahead and open it so. I'll have Visual Studio code Type like. this and open it. so we see a welcome tab over here we can. close this welcome Tab and explore what. all is there in the vs code tab as of. now there's no project here so it looks. very empty but we'll create a flutter. project open at nvs code and that will. look much better but as of now let's. just take a look at the blank and mtvs. code. so the first tab that we have here is. the Explorer tab the Explorer tab helps. us to view the files. and the subfolders present in a folder. so if we have a flutter project it will. have many folders and files of our. application we can see all of them over. here the second one is the search tab in. the search tab you can find a specific. word. from multiple files and multiple folders. so if you want to search just one word. or just one function name you can type. it over here and it will output. all the files that contain that function. name. then we have the source control tab. remember git that we installed this is. not the tab we are going to look at. because that's a separate world of its. own. I'll be releasing a separate tutorial on. Source control with get so you don't. have to worry about it for now. the next one is run on debug this is a. place where you can run and debug your. applications and the final tab we see. here is the extensions tab. the extensions tab allow us to add. additional features to our code editor. so we'll be installing a bunch of. extensions so that our flutter code. looks better and we have an increased. productivity in our coding but for now. I'm not going to install anything I'll. install all of the extensions one by one. so that you see the difference. of using an extension and not using an. extension. then here we have the errors and. warnings tab so it tells us what errors. and warnings there are and when you. click on it it opens a separate window. of its own here we see problems so it. will output any problems that are. present in our App application so it can. be. a warning or an error. so in dot pad you remember how we saw. warnings that a variable was induced. or an error which said like when we had. print statement and we put in two to. three arguments it said you cannot pass. two to three arguments to a print. function all those kind of Errors can be. seen from here in one particular place. then we have output so it will output. anything we want then we have debug. console so whenever you run your. application all the print statements and. everything can be seen over here. how is output different from debug. console then output will basically tell. you more about the. project as a whole for example. whenever you add an external dependency. so remember in our DOT code we add but. an HTTP dependency. where whenever we add it to our Florida. project it will show. all the dependencies present in our. application in the output here and debug. console basically tells us what is. happening when we are running the. application then we have the terminal so. this is an inbuilt terminal. this terminal that we had right over. here. that is an external terminal meaning it. is coming from the system itself this is. coming from vs code so we can eliminate. using this terminal right here and we. can just start using integrated terminal. all the time that makes sense and you. can add as many terminals as you want by. clicking on the plus button over here. and delete whenever you want to delete. it then if you close the closed tab it. will just close this window right here. then you have the feedback option and. the notifications tab over here so you. can come back to Explorer now the next. step is to create a flutter project and. the first project that we are going to. create is a currency converter. application. so to create a flutter project there are. again two steps you can take you can. open up your terminal from your or from. the BS code terminal now to open vs. codes integrated terminal you can press. command J if you're on Mac and that will. open the terminal right over here okay. and you can again press command J to. hide it or you can just use the terminal. over here both of them work. Now to create a flutter project first. you need to go to the folder where you. want to create a flutter project I want. to go to the desktop folder because. that's where I want to create a flutter. project. and after that I'll run the command. flutter create. and then the name of the project which. is currency converter. so this will create a flood up project. by the name of currency converter and. then when I click on enter. it creates a project please note that. when you have flutter create you need to. put underscore over here in case you. want to. put a space because if you just put a. space it won't be allowed it will give. you an error you can try it for your own. and camel casing is generally not the. convention to name a flood a project it. is generally named like this so if you. have a space you just use an underscore. just like the Instagram usernames now we. can just take this folder and drag it. away up and there we go we have. everything related to our flutter. project here. and as you can see there are multiple. folders over here you can see that in vs. code as well but there are a few things. more that you can see in vs code which. is dot dot tool. which you cannot see it over here and. Dot idea which again you cannot see it. over here. to see it you can just press command. shift full stop and you'll see all the. hidden files over here. and again press command shift full stop. so you'll stop seeing the hidden files. so vs code helps us see the hidden files. as well now let's go over the folders. one by one so dot tool and Dot idea is. nothing that we should be concerned. about we should be concerned about. folders starting from here so we have. Android folder so it's related to all. the Android permissions that might. require. so whenever you have an app that wants. some permission from Android related. stuff. you'll use this folder and it basically. has the entire structure of an Android. application a native Android application. right here. then we have the iOS folder. this has the structure similar to an iOS. folder whenever you want to give any. extra permission you'll have to open. this iOS folder in xcode and you can. give your permissions that are required. then we have the lip folder the most. important folder in our flutter project. this is where you're going to write all. your Dart code and here we have just one. file which is the main dot dot file and. as you can see this might look familiar. void Main. function and this has a dot dot. extension which basically means that. this is a dart file and if this is a DOT. file we already know main function is. where the application begins. so this is the starting point of our app. and. the lib folder is where you're going to. install or you know add more of your. files. and build your entire application then. we have the Linux Mac OS folder similar. to the Android and iOS folder if you. want to give any permissions you'll give. them over here for Linux and Mac OS then. we add the test folder test folder is. related to the testing of our app by. testing I do not mean like a normal user. testing it you know when a user uses. their phone and uses the app that's not. called testing I'm talking about. automated testing. meaning you just write a bunch of code. so that you confirm that this piece of. code is working. it won't make sense now but after you've. built a few applications you'll. understand what I'm talking about then. we have the web folder web folder. contains all the assets the index.html. file basically the entire web structure. then we have the windows as well then we. have get ignore which is related to. Source control so whenever you have to. upload to something known as GitHub. you'll need this get ignore files which. ignores all the unnecessary files in our. project then we have metadata. and as you can see it already tells us. this file tracks properties of this. flutter project it's nothing we should. be concerned about so we can just skip. this part then we have analysis options. dot yianl you remember the warnings and. errors we used to get we can configure. such that we get more specific errors or. warnings in our Florida project. then we have currency converter dot IML. nothing we should be concerned about. then we have pubspec.log and. pubspec.yaml. so pubspect.yaml consists of. all the details of our flutter project. for example the name of the project the. description of the project then this. line which is related to pub.dev you. remember the site where we went to. install HTTP plugin so if we create our. own dot project and we want to publish. it to pub.dev. then we need to remove this line if we. are only building a flutter app. and that is not to be published on. pub.dev we can keep this line. that we have the version number of our. Florida project or the flutter app. so if you have ever noticed every. application has a version attached to it. so if you just click on an app and go to. its app info you'll see the version for. it for example the WhatsApp version as. of now is 2.23.11.77. that's what this version number allows. us to do it allows us to upload to App. Store Play Store and all the other. stores without creating the confusion. that two projects are similar or the. same so you can have unique versions. every time you upload to app store or. Play Store then we have environment so. this tells us the flutter SDK we'll be. using in this project and. the hdk we are using is basically. greater than or equal to 3.0.5 but less. than 4.0.0 so you can use anything from. flutter 3 to flutter 4 over here and it. will obey all the rules you can also. decrease your SDK so you can just put. two over here. and it can be less than three so it will. follow all the rules related to flutter. 2 to flutter 3. but obviously you need. to make sure that you have fluttered two. installed for that but it's always good. to stay on the latest SDK not on the. previous SDK because you need to keep up. with the advancements in your framework. right if we have flutter. we always need to make sure that we are. updated to it so that we can use all its. latest features. then we add the dependencies tab and in. the dependency the first one we have is. flutter which is coming from the flutter. SDK itself. and we have the Cupertino icons the. Cupertino icons dependency can be found. on pub.dev. but it basically allows us to use iOS. styled icons Cupertino. everywhere in our flutter code is going. to relate to the iOS part so if you have. Cupertino icons we have IOS style icons. then we have Dev dependencies we already. know what dependencies are. we have already installed a dependency. not DOT pad which was the HTTP Plugin or. the HTTP package. in-depth dependencies we have. dependencies related to the developer so. if developer needs anything that will. help. the developer to you know write code and. increase productivity they can use that. but it doesn't affect the user Behavior. at all okay so whatever you have over. here is just related to the developer. having a better environment and here we. have the flutter lens. package and the federal lens package is. connected to the analysis option.yaml. which is our linter you can see include. package flutter lens flutter.aml. I know this might not make sense but we. are just starting right now as we move. ahead you'll understand what I'm talking. about. then we have flutter which says users. material design to true then you have. something related to assets we'll get. into it then we have something related. to fonts as well we'll get into it. and that's pretty much all about. pubspec.yaml. foreign. contains all the packages that we might. have installed. and keeps the track of the version. number the description from where it. came everything. and at last we have the readme.md so if. you want anyone to read your. project and you know you have certain. guidelines to follow you can have a. readme aware which tells everything. about it and if you click on this icon. all of this text away or translate to. this this is what dot MD represents MD. is short for markdown so whenever you. have hashtag like this it thinks this is. an H1 kind of title a bigger title then. you have a normal text then you have. two hashtags which is a smaller. header. then you have smaller text then you have. links and all of that stuff. so this basically allows. any other engineer working on your. project to read more about it and you. know understand how to contribute and. all of that stuff. so we can close this and we have two the. entire flutter project now let's go to. the main.dot file which is where we are. going to be 90 of the times not in the. main.file but in the lip folder in. general we can create more dot files we. can do more things and 95 percent of the. times you're just going to stay in the. slip folder and not move out of it. because this is where the entire flutter. project is cooked. so yeah this is where we are main.dot. file now what I want to do is there's a. bunch of code written here by default I. just want to run it but even before. running there are a few things I want to. do for example you might not be able to. see this font so I just want to increase. the font size over here to increase it I. am going to press command shift p. settings. then click on open settings. click on text editor over here. click on font and here I can increase my. font size so my font size can be let's. say 20. click on enter come over here and it. zoomed in a little bit too much so I. think I'm going to go ahead with 18. this is better but what about 17. I. think 18 works well for me and I hope. you're also able to see this I'm also. going to put this panel like this so. that my code gets more space. and that looks cool now another problem. that I have here is the highlighting. part by highlighting I mean. I just don't want my code Editor to look. blue white. and just orange you know I want more. colors to be present if you look at take. a look at dot pad you'll see extension. which of the keyword is in green. extension name is an orange color on is. again a keyword so green a data type so. it's in white color again a data types. white color function or a variable name. is in blue color so I want a similar. kind of highlighting to be present so. that it's easy for me to distinguish. between dot stuff and a lot of stuff all. right. so for that I can again press command. shift p. type preferences and I'll find something. like color theme over here I just need. to click it and change the theme over. here so if I change the team to dark. Plus. you see there is a colored change over. here. now it's not no longer just white and. blue it has multiple colors over here. blue is a keyword a class name has green. color. again this is a keyword widget. is a class built as a function so it has. all of the proper. highlighting that I wanted. now the next step is to run the default. code that is provided by flutter and. just take a look at how flutter looks. when it just creates a project for us. and we do absolutely nothing. so for this how can we run well we can. just go to the Run tab run without. debugging and it tells us that we don't. have an extension for debugging dot. should we find a DOT extension in the. marketplace you can click over here but. I'm just going to click on a cancel. because I know what to do. it's not the DOT extension that we are. looking for we are looking for something. related to flutter. vs code tells that because we are in a. dart file it doesn't know that we are. running a flutter related project so we. don't need to find a extension specific. to dot we need to find an extension. specific to flutter. so we'll go to the extensions tab over. here type flutter click on enter. and it gives us the extension flutter. which is provided by the dot team or the. Google team itself we can just click on. install aware. and what this will do is basically. provide us with a set of tools which. will allow us to edit refactor run and. debug our applications. and when we install the flutter. extension another extension that we get. by default is the dart extension because. flutter included Dot. so it only makes sense to include the. dart extension as well. now we can come over here close this. extension go to the main.dot file and. you see we have a new bulb icon showing. up here then we have run debug profile. three buttons right here. on the right hand side we have devices. showing up where we can select from Mac. OS Chrome IO simulator or pixel emulator. which is the Android emulator. since we installed xcode we got access. to iOS simulator since we installed. Android Studio it default. created. the pixel emulator if you don't see. pixel emulator over here you can just go. ahead and create your own Android. emulator all right and if you see an. error like this what you need to do is. just go to Android studio right here. click on more actions virtual device. manager. and click on create a device select the. phone that you want from your let's say. pixel 4 XL. or let's go ahead with pixel 6 then we. click on next we'll use the API 34 the. default one if you want to change the. API so let's say you want to use. Android or Android s whatever you can. use that I'm going to go ahead with the. API 34.. click on next then we have pixel 6 API. 34. all the default options. if you want you can change the Android. advance settings as well where you can. change the ram. the virtual memory Heap the internal. storage so we can change the internal. storage to GB and let's say. 550 GB. whatever you want I'm just kidding you. know just have 20 GB like this then. click on finish and that creates an. emulator for you if you want to run it. you can just click on this. launch icon or you can just come over. here and you'll see the pixel 6 API 34. emulator scene over here. and if you want to default remove the. default pixel emulator that it created. for you you can go ahead and click on. these three options delete and it will. delete it for you. so let's delete it we only want to keep. just one emulator over here and if we. again go to the devices the device is no. longer there there's just pixel 6 API. 34.. so let's go ahead and run the. project so where do we want to run it. well we want to run it on let's say. Chrome. so we'll select the Chrome device over. here. then we'll click on run and it will. start running it for you. you see there are a bunch of things that. happened here it opened the debug. console so it is launching lib slash. main.dot on Chrome and debug mode so. this tells us a thing about flutter and. Dot by default it goes to the lib slash. main dot dot file to run the project so. this is the first file to get executed. in after project. then we have this settings thing right. here it gives us a bunch of settings. over here for example if you want to. pause the debugging if you want to. restart your application if you want to. hot reload your application if you want. to stop it so if you stop it this thing. right here will get executed. exited so if you close this. you see the web application is now gone. so again let's click on run and it will. start running it for you and we also. have this search icon which is widget. inspector page so if you click over here. it doesn't start anything right now but. again if you click over here it will. open the widget inspector widget. inspector is a kind of thing that allows. you to see how your application is. structured but we'll get to it later on. because you don't know what widgets are. right so let's close this. and there we go we have a floss flutter. app right here we have this good looking. app and this increment button if I click. over here it just increases this thing. right here so it's a very basic app. running on web if you want to run more. apps you can do it simultaneously so you. can open it and run it on Mac OS so. click on run your run without debugging. which is another way to run your flutter. apps you can either do it over here you. can either do it over here or you can. just run the command flutter Run Okay so. that works as well. so let's just click on run over here as. well which opens it on Mac OS so we have. our application running on Chrome and. Mac OS both. we can also run three apps in one place. so we'll start the iOS simulator first. because. it's not running in the background like. Mac OS and chrome so we'll first have to. start the simulator and here we have. iPhone 14 pro Max. which is given to us by xcode so it's. loading right now we can also start our. pixel emulator so we'll just click on. this. start icon right here and that. will launch as well and as you can see. the Mac OS part is running here. if I just expand this. is our Mac OS app and this is our web. app both of them look very similar right. almost the same. that is because of flutter. you can run one code base so you have. a consistent looking UI design on both. your. Mac OS app and your Windows app and it. works the same way okay nothing is. different right here now we also have. our pixel emulator and iPhone radio so. we can run those as well and they'll. work. side by side as well just make sure you. have the current device selected over. here so that you launch it over there if. I want to run it on iPhone I'll just. click on run run without debugging with. iPhone selected aware if I want to run. pixel I'll select pixel over here and. run it so whatever you select over here. and when you click over and run over. here. that device will be run I hope that was. clear and if you click over here there. are four devices we are connected to and. running at the same time if you press. command J it opens the terminal you can. go to the debug console. you have Macos over here. Chrome right over here. pixel 6 loading and iPhone loading as. well. now I don't like running all of the. platforms at the same time because. we can lose out on a lot of battery very. quickly because we are running on four. platforms together. what I like to do is run on two. platforms at the most so it can be. iPhone. Android iPhone web depending on where I. want to launch it. so if I want to build an app only for. Android and iOS it makes sense to only. use Android and iOS at the same time or. if you're sure that it will have a. consistent UI design on both Android and. iOS there will be no changes. you can just run it on one device if you. want to launch your app on all the. devices. or on all the platforms then you can. just have maybe a web platform and an. iOS simulator running. so it really depends on you if you want. your battery to get exhausted very. quickly. you can go ahead and run on all the four. platforms there's no problem with it. so our iPhone process is almost done you. can see xcode well done. and it uses the impeller run rendering. backend we'll get into what impeller is. but if we just come over here here is. our iPhone application and when we click. over here we are able to see the same. thing that we saw over here and here so. we are able to run our app on all the. platforms let's get done with the. Android one as well it is installing a. bunch of things once it completes. installing it will start running the. application and then. we can start designing our currency. converter app from scratch and while. Android is being run let's take a look. at a few more things I want to get into. first one is the file explorer tab over. here it looks very plain doesn't it. what I want here is certain symbols to. be present so that I can distinguish. between an iOS folder or a lib folder. really quickly so for that we have an. extension which is called vs code icons. there are a bunch of vs code extensions. related to file icons. but my favorite one is vs code icons. which you can click on install and it. will bring icons to your file explorer. and here you see after you install it it. said it asks you to select a file icon. theme vs code icons or city which is. provided by Visual Studio code itself I. want vs code icons because that's better. for me. I'll come over here and you see all of. my folders now have a unique icon to it. so we have Android which gives us. something similar to Android build iOS. so we have Apple logo. Linux Mac OS test. web windows so everything has a. different icon to it so I can. distinguish between all of them really. quickly and it just helps me overall. also I can see that the pixel emulator. is now working. so I can just come over here and there. we go we have our app showing here as. well so it looks similar on all the. platforms That's The Power of using. flutter so now what I'm going to do is. exit from almost all the platforms just. keep one platform on the side so that I. have a perspective of what's going on so. I'll close Chrome I'll close Mac OS I'll. close pixel as well. I'll just keep the iPhone on the side. rest all the things are now gone. I can also close the Android emulator if. I want so I'll just select this click on. command Q. it will save the state and close the. pixel emulator for us awesome now we. just have the is simulator here and now. we can start preparing our currency. converter app so this is where we are. going to start writing real flutter and. Dot code so to begin our work on the. currency converter app what I'm going to. do is press command a so that I select. everything present in the main.dot file. then I'm going to backspace everything. and we'll start writing everything from. scratch yes we are going to need a lot. of components that are already mentioned. over here these are sort of boilerplate. code meaning if you don't have them your. flutter app won't work properly. so you need to have them but we'll start. writing everything from scratch so that. we understand why we need them in the. first place for example the stateless. widget thing this material app thing all. of those things right so let's backspace. it. then like every DART program we need to. create a main function because that's. our entry point to the DART program. so what happens is flutter just searches. for main.dot file in lib folder when it. gets main.dart it searches for the main. function in the main.dot file and then. you can see we get these three options. to run our app so now we have a simple. dot program with us what we need to do. is tell flutter to come into action and. start running the app so how can we do. that to do that we have a simple. function given by the flutter SDK itself. which is run up because we want to run. the app right. so we'll pass and run up over here which. is a function coming from some import. line like this so as soon as we had run. app over here it automatically imported. this line right here now what is this. line well let's break this down we have. import so it's importing some package. some file some. other project some other folder and that. is the flutter package. and in Florida package it's the. material.dot now you might say hey this. line seems very similar to what we had. in the dart section we had import. package HTTP. http.dot this was the case because we. were importing. http.dot file from HTTP package we are. doing the same thing over here but with. flutter we are importing the. material.dot file from the flutter. package if you're curious how we are. importing package flutter. if you just go to the pubspect.aml file. dependencies this is where all the. dependencies come in. so anything extra your app depends on. that is not related to Dot comes in over. here so we have the flutter dependency. over here and this is coming from SDK. philadel. unlike Cupertino underscore icons that. is coming from pop.dev. unlike the HTTP package that was coming. from pub.dev this flutter is coming from. the SDK flutter. and what is this SDK flutter well it's. the same thing that you installed on. your system locally and it's good to. mention SDK flutter like this and not. give any path to it because the path of. the flutter can change. maybe you reinstall it somewhere else so. just having SDK flutter like this is a. better thing so we can close. pubspect.aml file and when we again come. over here we can see package flutter is. imported and from there we are importing. the material.dart file why material.dot. file because material.dot file gives us. many of flutters functions classes. methods that we can use for example the. run app file or the run app function. because in Dart we don't have anything. like run app. in Dart we have already seen we have. stuff like string and all of that. stuff like string. integer Boolean async keyword all of. this can be used without importing the. flutter library or the flutter package. but stuff like run app cannot be run. without importing flutter all right. and to import flutter you need to have. flutter installed and you need to make. sure that in perspect.aml file you have. the dependency present so again coming. back to run app so this import line. right here is quite important and you'll. see later on how many times this. material.dot is used in your flutter app. it's almost used in every single file. you create because it also gives you. access to certain widgets. or certain UI things which is quite. helpful so now coming back to the run. app function what exactly is this run up. function if you just hover over this. you'll see the definition of this. function it is void run app. and then it requires a parameter of. widget app. so that means an app is not returning. anything and it requires something known. as widget app and since we don't know. what widget is that is not even a DOT. related thing so that means widget is. again something created by flutter team. themselves it's a thing in flutter so it. might be a custom class that they. created but we are still not sure so to. understand this what you can do is press. command. so you can click on run app then. and when you click over here you get. dive. into the flutter source code as you can. see over here users Advance are not slot. up so I'm going into the flutter SDK. that I installed locally on my system to. take a look at this definition and. understand what this widget thing is. and as you can see when I go in the. definition when I hover over widget it. says that it's an abstract class widget. and we already know what abstract. classes are. again if you want to take a look at the. definition of widget you can press. command again and then click on widget. and you'll dive into the source code of. abstract class widget. but we are not diving into the flutter. source code now. I just wanted to show this to you let's. not make things complicated. so now this requires something known as. a widget what is this widget. widgets are the building blocks of the. user interface they are responsible for. describing what the UI should look like. so let's take an example of the counter. app over here if I want to describe that. hey in my app I want the header like. this. a pink or purple kind of background with. some text on it then I want some texts. over here then I want a button over here. and on that button I want this plus type. of icon to be displayed so all of these. things are widgets because they describe. what my screen what my user interface is. going to look like. so that's exactly what we want to pass. to run app. and this widget can be literally. any UI component right so I can just put. in a text which is again provided by. flutter material.dot and you have to. instantiate that text text again is a. class if you press command and go to the. text definition you'll see it is a class. text all right and also one thing that I. didn't mention please don't change. anything over here. if you change anything in the flutter. source code it will behave differently. for you over here and that can cause a. lot of problems. so take this as a read-only file if you. just want to take a look at what's going. on inside and you're just curious in. general. but do not edit it anything at all. because if it stops. behaving the way you want it to you'll. have to reinstall everything and that. can be quite a headache unnecessarily. so you can close this now. so now we have the text over here and. that is a widget. so this text requires us to pass in a. data as you can see whenever we. instantiate a class. it tells us what all stuff is required. in this text. and the thing that's required over here. is string data and that is a positional. argument that's why we are getting the. error over here saying one positional. argument expected by text Dot Nu but. zero found. we've already seen these kind of errors. in the dot section. so let's pass a string over here. and let's call my text hello world so. this string right here is what the text. should display right if we have a. texture you have pushed this button this. many times that is a text right if. that's a text the string data part is. this thing right here so that's what. I've typed in over here hello world. then I'll put a semicolon over here save. it I'll ignore the warning for now also. anything in blue underline is a warning. anything with a red underline is a. warning or is an error also anything. with blue underline is a warning and. anything with red underline is an error. you can ignore warnings although you. shouldn't. but you cannot ignore errors because if. there's an error your flutter app won't. build if there's a warning your flutter. app can still build but it's recommended. to fix the warnings before moving on and. now when we save it you see this thing. right over here. we get a pop-up saying hot reload. completed what is this hot reload thing. hot reload is when you have a small UI. tweak or some small change made in your. code and then when you save the file. you don't have to restart your entire. system over here to see those changes. in hot reload you can just save your. file and it will display the small UI. tweaks present in your code. so you don't have to completely restart. your app and start everything from. scratch you can just save it. and you'll be able to see the small UI. tweak if there is no small UI tweak. then you'll have to restart your app how. do we restart the app by clicking over. here. on the city start button and as you can. see when we restart we get. some different kind of message over here. with red background this is an error all. right. the red warnings or the red underlines. displayed over here were compile time. errors we've already known about that in. the dot section. but this ones are runtime errors. and you can also see runtime errors or. compile time. errors when you press command J. in the debug console and you see they've. mentioned the problem over here. now. these error messages also contain the. stack Trace in the terminal over here. you don't see the stack Trace what is. stack Trace stack Trace basically allows. us to know where in our application the. error occurred because if our. application grows vast it can be a bit. difficult to know hey this is where the. error occurred right so stack Trace. already tells us hey you have a runtime. error and this is where data code so. that's what text helps me with. and as you can see the error is the. relevant error causing widget was text. okay so some error occurred related to. text wire. and then you have the exception Throne. this was the stack and this just goes. deep into the framework telling you hey. this file this file this file this file. is where the error occurred but we don't. have to care that much about these lines. because it's related to the framework. and we'll anyways not be able to. understand what's going on. so we can just scroll up and you see the. following assertion was thrown building. text hello world so it's related to this. thing only. but to be honest I don't understand. anything that's mentioned over here but. I do understand this thing no. directionality widget found what does. this directionality widget found mean. it is at least legible English you know. but still it's quite difficult to. understand what's directionality widget. with respect to this text widget well. the point over here is this text. requires you to pass in. a direction property we need to specify. the direction property over here because. we need to specify the text position on. the screen. do we want the text from to go from left. to right or do we want the text to go. from right to left that's what we want. to figure out where on the screen should. it be over here or over here. that's why it was giving us this error. so let's understand how we can fix that. and many a times you can fix the problem. by looking at the properties of the. particular widget or the particular text. class and see if there is a property. related to direction to fix it. and the property is text direction right. and as you can see this is a named. argument. the first thing was a positional. argument and after that we had named. arguments that were optional. so we can pass text Direction. over here now you might ask if text. direction is necessary without text. Direction it is giving us this error. why don't they make text Direction. property non-optional as well just like. data right. if text direction is required in our. text property without it it is giving us. an error why do we want X direction to. be empty or nullable or optional the. reason for that is most of the times you. won't be writing text widget like this. over here you'll be using something. known as material app that we are going. to look into in just a moment. in just a while but. there direction for text is already. defined so you don't have to Define it. over there. so it is optional but as of now just for. me demoing basic flood or app to you. it's required. so for now you can blindly just put text. Direction it will make much more sense. when we have so as of now you can just. put text Direction like this. blindly but later on you'll understand. what I'm talking about. when we start using material app and. those kind of stuff. so we have X Direction over here. and this text Direction requires text. Direction now is text Direction a class. to understand that we have to press. command and then we can go into the text. Direction source code but it tells. nothing about text Direction. why because this is the Constructor we. have to go to the place where text. direction is initialized so. we can click over text Direction and. here we are final text Direction which. is empty text Direction now to. understand if text direction is a class. or not we hover over this. and it tells us it's not a class it's an. enum. so text Direction can have a certain. limit of values now what are those. values you can again click command so. you go to the text Direction. enum definition and here it is. and it can have two values RTL or LTR. and as you can see it's already defined. over here with something known as a. documentation comment this was the third. type of comment. in flutter we or Dot. in flutter or dot in the dot course we. saw that there are two types of comments. first one was. single line comment another one was. multi-line comment and this is a third. type of comment which is the. documentation comment by documentation. comment what happens is whenever I. initialize text direction or use text. Direction and hover over it you'll see a. definition. or the description of this text. Direction property. and somewhere when you scroll you'll see. this thing right here the text flows. from right to left example Arabic Hebrew. you won't see that over here because. this is present inside the enum but if. you see documentation comments are. present over here as well which is. related to the text Direction so if we. just go at the top. you'll see a direction in which text. flows some languages are written from. the left to right so if you come over. here hover over this you'll see a. direction in which text flows so. basically with documentation comments. you'll be able to see some changes over. here. some stuff or description written over. here which is quite nice because then. you don't have to Google stuff up and. understand what's required you can just. look at the source code and understand. what's required. so let's close this let's close this and. let's give text Direction up. value and that will be text Direction. Dot and we get Auto suggestion the auto. suggestion is LTR or R2L. and values is just a list or containing. RTL or LTR so I'm just going to have LTR. because I wanted to show up over here. left to right so it will show up. somewhere over here then I'll save it. but if I come away a hot reload doesn't. work because this is quite a massive. change. so you'll have to restart your entire. app and then you'll be able to see Hello. World over here we are not able to see. it properly but yeah it is written over. there. now if I just mention let's say four. exclamation marks save it I'm not seeing. it again because this is a massive. change. so after I restart I'll be able to see. it. but later on when we start adding. material app and we make small UI tweaks. you'll be able to see the great power of. hot reload which is what makes flutter. very different from other Frameworks. because many other Frameworks don't have. the support for hot reload and it's. quite a wonderful feature in my opinion. and now if I press RTL over here instead. of LTR and restart the app I see text. over here and my exclamation marks go. right in the right so that was about. text and you know just displaying some. stuff up but now let's get into. more complex things because obviously we. don't just want to return a text over. here and. for bigger apps this is not possible why. because simple apps don't just show UI. right they have many more things going. on in the back end it's not about. databases of servers that I'm talking. about. not the back end related stuff I'm. talking about stuff like. navigation by navigation I mean moving. from one page to another so if I have. one page then I want to move to another. page. bigger apps can do that for example. YouTube if I use youtube.com I see the. home page when I click on a video I'll. go to another page that contains the. video player so bigger apps have. multiple pages in them and moving from. one page to another in an app is called. navigation just like moving from one. place to another in real life is known. as navigating right so bigger apps have. support for that and it can't be done by. just using text we need to use something. else which is known as material app or. it can be Cupertino app now we are going. to dive into both of them but before. that we'll have to understand some other. Concepts now you know. just having a text widget isn't what a. real app like real app will look like it. will have one screen of its own and in. that screen there are going to be many. components as well for example if you. just open google.com it's a very simple. looking page but it has a lot of. components here first of all it has the. header right up at the top Gmail images. all of this stuff then it has the Google. logo over here then it has the text. field that takes our input then it has. two buttons then it has this thing which. helps us in Translation then it has. footer and that too two Footers I guess. so it has a lot of components and in. flutter every component can be a widget. right so if you're coming from other. Frameworks like react you already know. what components are whatever UI building. block is there and in flutter widgets. are components my point is that this app. will grow into something big that will. have many components on the screen so. what I want to do is make sure my app is. broken down into several smaller widgets. so that more Engineers can work on it at. the same time just imagine my entire app. present in this function right here I. can do that it's totally possible so I. can build my entire app all the widgets. let's say the entire Google Chrome. screen I can build in this function but. do you think that's feasible because it. is it will become such a big thing right. it will have like hundreds and thousands. of lines of code all enclosed within. this function so I obviously want to. break it down so that more Engineers can. work your net together. and when it's broken down you can allot. different files to it different classes. to it and Engineers can work on net at. the same time and it will boost. productivity so that's what I want to do. I want to segregate. this text widget in a widget of its own. that won't have any UI change but it. will definitely have a productivity. boost for our application. so let's go ahead and create our own. custom widget. not custom widget but our own widget and. we can do that by creating a class. because widgets at the end of the day. are classes if you press command go to. the text definition you'll see text is a. class as well and it extends something. known as stateless widget to become a. widget. so we need to do the same thing. my widget is going to be named as my app. nothing too fancy there. because if I name this as text then it. will be a problem right. because then it will get confused do you. want text from material.dot the thing. that is coming from flutter or do you. want to use your own text widget that. you've created so better to just name it. something else because there are. hundreds of other names you can choose. so you can have mic app. extending something known as stateless. widget now what is the stateless widget. stateless widget first of all is a type. of a widget and there are multiple types. of widgets by multiple I mean three. first one is. stateless widget which we have seen. right now the second one is a state full. widget. and the third one is inherited widget. so widgets can be broadly classified in. these three types. stateless widget and stateful widgets. are what we are going to discuss while. building the first app. we need to thoroughly understand this. then the third one inherited widget is a. more complex topic to understand so. we'll be discussing it in the second and. the third app all right so let's remove. this for now and let's just think we. have two types of widgets here. in terms of UI all right in terms of UI. related stuff there are only two widgets. inherited widget is for something else. so to understand stateless and stateful. widget you need to understand what state. is all right so to understand the state. let's take an example of our counter. application. what will be the state over here well. State refers to any data that will. determine how your widget should look. like how it should be rendered or how it. should behave so this text over here can. be. a state the text below it the 0 is a. state why because. these two things are data. that determine how the widget should. render how it should behave how it. should look like right even this app bar. this button right here determine how the. screen will look like but that's not the. definition of state that's the. definition of a widget. State refers to data that will determine. how the widget should look like. so these two things are data that will. determine how the widget will look like. how the screen will look like and app. bar and this button will determine how. the screen will look like they are not. really data right. so these two things are data over here. so that's what state is to shorten the. definition you can say state is some. data that your widget will care about. right now what is stateless widget so it. is State less widget does this mean it. does not have any state at all no. it's very unlikely that your app does. not have any state at all your app will. usually have States. that's what gives your app meaning right. if I just remove the Zero from here and. this you have pushed the button this. many times text from here do you think. this apps this app makes any sense at. all not really. so your app will have state it's very. unlikely that your app does not have a. state. but just means that your. app or your widget will have list State. and by list State I mean. in a stateless Widget the state is. immutable the data is immutable meaning. once the widget is created it cannot be. changed. so suppose this was a stateless widget. it's not really a stateless widget. you'll understand in a moment but if. this was a stateless widget then this. text wouldn't change at all this text. you have pushed the button this many. times does not change at all but even. the 0 would not change when I click over. here all right that's what stateless. would do but stateful does what happens. over here when I click on this button. the state changes so I hope you. understood the difference between. stateless and stateful widget stateless. basically has the state immutable so. the state doesn't change at all. and in state full the state can change. it's not immutable it is mutable so. whenever you want mutable state or state. that can change you'll use stateful. wizard otherwise stateless measure. so for now I've extended my app with. status widget. but as soon as I extend the stateless. widget my app gives me an error. it has this red underline which tells. it's an error. and you can see the error is missing. concrete implementation of stateless. widget dot build. why. if I just remove this extent stateless. widget this is a new class and that's. fine right but I have to extend it with. a stateless widget so that it becomes a. widget I cannot. not extend it and put it in run app I. have to extend it so after I extend it. it gives me this error meaning stateless. widget. is telling us to override some functions. and we've seen that before because at. the end of the day stateless widget is. an abstract class whenever you extend an. abstract class you need to override its. function and redefine its implementation. so what we need to do over here is add. up the rate override. widget. dot build right not exactly why just go. to the stateless widget definition. scroll down and you'll find widget build. aware this is what we need to override. this is what is defined in the abstract. gloves now you'll ask hey. stateless element create element is also. defined over here right but. that's. defined whether it's implementation. because stateless widget is extending. widget. and widget is basically telling. stateless widget to override a method of. element create element which is what the. stateless widget is doing now if you. don't understand this don't worry for. now you'll understand this later on when. we get into widget trees elementaries. and render objects but for now don't. don't worry about it if you don't get it. but if you get it awesome. so basically. the only thing you need to understand as. of now is widget build build context. this thing needs to be defined so we can. just copy it. we can paste it over here with other. rate override at the top then create a. function out of it but this gives us an. error this gives us an error because. this is a function right we need to. Define its implementation now to Define. its implementation. we have to return a widget. because this is a function this function. takes a build context. and then we need to return a widget from. here. so basically we need to return a widget. and that is why it's giving us an error. the error says. the body might completely normal causing. null to be returned but the return type. widget is a potentially non-nullable. type if we had widget like this aware it. would have caused no errors but. unfortunately or fortunately that's not. the case we need to return a widget all. the time from a stateless widget so we. can just copy this text right at the top. then return text like this and the error. goes away also now we can just take this. my app and put it over here. and make sure you have these. parenthesis because it's a class right. you need to instantiate it. and now when you save it and restart. your app you don't see any changes there. but what happened over here is you don't. have to continuously build your app. in this run app function you can just. pass my app class and now you can start. editing in the my app class. that's what I was talking about. by extending to a stateless widget or a. stateful widget you're just making sure. that your app. is divided into smaller pieces if you. have your app divided into smaller. pieces many people can work on it. together and. make more progress. so I hope you understood the purpose a. stateless widget but still we have. warnings to fix we have these blue. underlines to fix. so. let's go over them one by one. starting with my app now if you hover. over this you'll see Constructors for. public widgets should have a named key. parameter. this is basically saying that hey you. extended stateless widget now stateless. widget you override the build function. that's all good. now you can create your app I won't bug. you. with the compile time or runtime errors. but I'll still bug you with compile time. warnings. and this warning is there because if we. again go to stateless widget definition. you'll see this Constructor over here. constant stateless widget super dot key. and it did this. because it was extending widget when it. extended widget widget required. something known as a key for its. Constructor. right you can see it away a constant. widget this dot key so our abstract. class widget requires something known as. a key. and whenever you extend an abstract. class you'll have to pass that key to. the super class which is the widget and. that is what stateless widget did Super. dot key but where will stateless widget. get its key from it will get it from us. us the people who extend. stateless.widget the same thing happened. in text as well if you go to text. definition you'll see class text. extending stateless widget because text. also doesn't have. an immutable State because if you think. about it text also doesn't have a. mutable state obviously it will only. have its own immutable State that's why. it's extending a stateless widget then. it is having. its key defined somewhere over here if. you just search for it you'll see super. dot key so this is what we have to do. over here as well. we need to create a Constructor for my. app. which will be something like this super. dot key and now the error goes away now. what is the super dot key we've already. discussed about this in the dot section. if you remember we had a key. or something like this let's say string. data and then we had to give something. to the super class we would do. data like this right what happened over. here we are saying that hey you can. optionally pass data to us. and if you do pass or if you don't pass. we are just going to pass that value to. our super class. whenever we use super we refer to the. abstract class super right so that's. what happened over here this requires. key so we have key optionally asked you. don't have to necessarily specify key. every time you instantiate my app. you can just ask for it and if you don't. want to pass that key you cannot pass in. and then you have to mention key over. here. so this is what we did when we did Super. dot key okay. this is just a shorthand syntax of this. long thing right here but basically this. means we are optionally taking some. stuff from The Constructor. and passing it to the Super Widget the. widget we are extending to in our case. the stateless widget and in stateless. widgets case widget now if you don't. understand the specifics don't worry. about it you'll still be able to build. apps without this knowledge but it's. better to have knowledge so that you can. build your apps with much more accuracy. and now if you see over here as soon as. we add constant Constructor over here. my app asks us to use constant so we. need to put constant over here what is. the purpose of this constant. the purpose of constant is to declare. that this Constructor is a compile time. constant by making the Constructor. constant you are just telling flood that. hey the widget instance that you've. created over here this my app class over. here doesn't need to be recreated every. single time you can just create it once. and that's enough this helps to improve. the performance of the app because the. number of times this object is created. is quite less. the same thing comes away when you hover. over this text you'll see use const with. the Constructor to improve performance. so again we have to use constant over. here so before returning many widgets. you'll have to put const before them. because it just tells that hey. this widget doesn't have to be rebuilt. you won't understand the purpose as of. now but when we get into the. currency converter app you'll understand. it better which you might have in your. mind what is a key now key is a class. that helps flutter identify and. differentiate between widgets by passing. a key to the Constructor you explicitly. assign a specific key to the specific. widget instance so if I pass a key to my. app. you are assigning the key to this. particular my app instance. and this ensures that the widget is. properly managed by. flutter's algorithm to update the. widgets whenever they update. now this won't make any sense to you. because keys are used in updating the. widget tree and all of those stuff but. you don't even know what widget tree is. as of now so again this is a part that. we'll cover in the widget Tree. Elementary. theory part for now let's just get the. app working right. so yeah. I hope you've understood it till now. from now every step we take will be. towards building the currency converter. app so in our app right now we are just. returning a text widget nothing else and. that's cool but. here's the problem I'm not following any. design guidelines or design rules within. which I'm restricted so I can build. whatever I want so that allows me to. build really exceptional UI designs or. it also allows me to create most of the. worst UI designs now I want to make sure. that doesn't happen I don't want to see. the worst case scenario when I'm working. with over 100 Engineers let's say so. what I want to do is make sure that my. app follows a particular guideline a. design system all right so for that. we have two types of designs given to us. by two major companies now there are. many more Design Systems but these are. the two most popular ones first one is. material design. and the second one is Cupertino design. so what are these designs and who made. them well material design is a design. System created by Google and Cupertino. design is the design System created by. Apple. now you can think of the difference. between Now Android apps look and how. iOS apps look and then you'll be able to. know. the difference between material design. and Cupertino design even if you scroll. up yours material.dot and this. material.dart is named after this. material design itself because. material.dot. if we click on command and go over there. inside you'll see all of the widgets. here we are going to use many of them. but all of these designs are. related to material design. and there's a similar. file in flutter related to iOS design as. well so if we just have package. flutter slash Cupertino dot dot instead. of material dot you can add Cupertino. design in your app we are going to see. the difference in both of them when we. build our currency converter app but as. of now we are just going to focus on. material design now how do I make sure. my app adds material design so for that. I'm going to return material apps from. here as simple as that I want a material. designed app so I'll return material app. now you can guess for yourself if you. want Cupertino design we can just have. Cupertino app and we'll be done and as. you can see it automatically Imports. cupertino.dot but for now as I said we. are just going to focus on material app. at the end when we are done completing. the currency converter app we are going. to see how this will look like in. Cupertino design and what all stuff we. need to change but as of now I'm not. going to reference Cupertino design. anymore we're just going to focus on. material design. so coming to this material app. there are lots of things we can do over. here and material app just does not set. the material design for our app it also. gives us multiple options to use or to. configure for example if you hover over. this we have Navigator key scaffold. messenger key home routes initial route. on generate route and a bunch of routes. then we also have theme and all the. theme related stuff then we have. localization all the localization. related stuff and a lot of small small. things. why I am telling you this is because. material app allows us to. set up navigation for our app if we just. return a text widget we won't be able to. move from one page to another without. doing anything we have to return either. a material app Cupertino app so that we. can set up navigation in our app and. same goes for theming same goes for. localization internationalization all of. that stuff. now if you're confused what theming. internationalization localization. navigation means we'll get to it when we. get to those certain topics and we dive. into it as of now you can just. understand that these allows for a lot. of stuff which just returning a text. can't do. okay so now I've returned a material app. now what should I do if I just save it. and you know restart the app and come. over here nothing shows up. even my text has gone because well I had. returned text from here and I removed it. now what should I do to return a text. again so for that. I can use one of the properties given by. material app which was home so I can. just pass home property here and as you. can see home property requires a widget. that can be optional. so I can just pass in let's say. a text again. and now I'll pass in hello world with. let's say four exclamation marks save it. and you come over here we see hello. world and now it's a different kind of. text altogether. and you notice one thing I didn't have. to mention text Direction over here I. could just pass in text and it worked. fine and I was able to see this text. right over here. why did that happen that happened. because material app sets up. the text formatting for your app or the. text design for your app if you press. command and come over here you won't be. able to understand where the text is. given its direction and all of that. stuff but you can take my word on it. otherwise you'll have to dive deep and. I'm sure you won't be able to understand. any of this even I don't understand it. but the point is how can I make this. text look better because this looks. absolutely terrible right what is this I. mean red color text with yellow. underline what is that none of the. current apps in our world use this. so how can I change it so to change it. we have to wrap our text with something. known as a scaffold. and usually material app. home property is followed by a scaffold. all right so we need a scaffold over. here and in this scaffold we can provide. the text and we'll be able to see the. text rendered properly not in a very bad. design. so if we put scaffold we'll discuss what. scaffold is. and in scaffold we have to provide the. text widget now how can I provide the. text widget well there's no home. property over here but there is a. property of body. and you can see Stafford provides very. intuitive names for everything over here. we have an app bar app bar is basically. the thing at the top the header then. there's body so the body is the middle. thing. just similar to an HTML element right so. in HTML you have header header is ABBA. then you have body body is this body so. it's kind of similar to HTML only if you. see it in one way. so we can pass body aware then our text. widget and then again we will type hello. world. and then our for exclamation mark we'll. save it and you come over here something. else only shows up we have a white. screen all of a sudden we have a text. showing up here and it looks wonderful. you know better than what we had earlier. how did this happen. so whenever we use a scaffold. scaffold tells the flutter framework. that hey. the programmer has used a scaffold. widget so we need to provide. user or the programmer all the. capabilities to add everything related. to a material design for example the. header if we don't use a scaffold we. won't be able to add header in any of. our apps material app will set the. overall theming and overall navigation. stuff for us but scaffold will make sure. that something related to one specific. page is done and scaffold will give us. access to headers Footers and all of. that stuff so to make sure you. understand this material app and. scaffold thing let's take a look at a. diagram. so let's say this big thing right here. is our material app what material app. does is set up a playground for us so. that we can do everything material. design related so we have material. design over here we have all the. navigation. localization internationalization. and theming all of them set up over here. so this looks after the overall app in. general. so this is kind of like on a global. scale. and what scaffold will do is basically. in our Global space set up one local. space of its own right over here and say. hey now you can add a header now you can. add a body now you can add a footer then. you can add a bunch of more stuff like. bottom sheets you know showing up a. dialog box we'll see all of that in our. app. but that's what scaffold does scaffold. looks after the. local part and material app looks after. the global part and in your app you can. only have one material app return right. it doesn't make sense to have material. app two or three times. but scaffold it makes sense to have. two or three. because if you don't have a scaffold. your text will be rendered in a very. and you won't like it. so I hope you understood the difference. with this diagram and things got clearer. now let's jump back into this and now. what I want to do is. make sure that my text comes right in. the center. every time I see my text it's right in. the corner who likes the text in the. corner I want it right in the center. over here. how can I do that I can do that by. making sure that text has a property of. a center. is that how it works not really if you. look over here you don't see anything. related to the text coming in Center yes. you can use text align property which. basically tells hey where do you want to. render your text where do you want to. align it do you want it in the left in. the right in the top in the bottom but. that is only when you have. full access of the screen. right now a text widget only occupies. this much space. it doesn't have the entire screen to. itself if it had the entire screen to. itself then it wouldn't be this small. right. if a text had access to the entire. screen it would spread across the entire. screen. text only has access to how much space. it acquires over here. so I cannot use the text align property. over here and I cannot use any of text. properties to do that because text. doesn't have that much control. just think about it in terms of a. kingdom. if a certain Kingdom if our widget if. our text widget is a certain Kingdom if. our certain Kingdom wants to come over. here how can they come they can only. come when they have access to the entire. area if they don't have access to. another area then they can't come over. here as a result. they'll only stay where they have their. control to understand this even better. let's take an analogy let's say our. widget aware this text widget is a. kingdom if this Kingdom wants to come. right over here in the center how will. it come can the wing kingdom just come. anywhere they want no they have to gain. control over this entire space so that. they can come right in the center. without any control on this land or on. this space no Kingdom can just move from. year to year. so same goes for our text widget for it. to come over here it needs to have. access to the entire space and the text. widget cannot have that because it only. takes as much space as it requires only. this much. so this Kingdom can do nothing about it. but yeah. something outside the kingdom can make. sure this kingdom comes away right so if. there's another kingdom and the annex. this Kingdom. then they can make sure that this. kingdom comes right away up in the. center so that's what we want to do we. want to make sure from outside that this. text comes in the center because from. inside text does not have any power. so what we need to do is wrap this text. with a center widget that's a widget. provided to us by flutter so in body. instead of having a text returned wire. I'm going to have Center. and then Center if you see there are. very less properties. we have key we have double width Factor. height factor and a child. what I want to use is neither of these. two things and the key is generally not. required. so we can just have a child and a child. is a text widget. so we say hello. world and then for exclamation mark save. it and when you come over here you see. hot reload Works away because this is. not a very big change this is quite a. small change to the framework and as. soon as I save anything. I don't have to restart this I can just. press command s it hot reloads and I see. the changes in real time. and even our text is centered now. so as you can see material app. scaffold Center text whatever I. mentioned in the center. will be centered the same way as. whatever I mentioned in the scaffold. will be scaffolded so anything you. mention inside of the center widget will. be centered so if you want to put a. button over here you can do that if you. want to put an image inside of this you. can do that and it will all be centered. and now we have our first good looking. Hello World app. now we want to start working on the. currency converter app but before that. I hope you've started to realize this. kind of chain of. widgets that we are making. in material art we add home then home. required a widget then scaffold body. body required a widget then we add. Center centers child required a wizard. and these are the three things all right. whenever there's material app. there will be home that you have to use. whenever you have scaffold there will be. body and whenever there's any other. widget other than scaffold or material. app you'll have the child property on it. except a widget like text you know. because text is itself displaying. something. stuff like Center is not actually. displaying anything on the screen right. it is just setting the alignment and the. layout but it's not setting. anything up on the screen for example. hello world is being displayed on the. screen. a button will be displayed on the screen. but a center will not be displayed on. the screen it's a way to tell the. flutter framework that hey. our programmer wants the app. content to be centered. so it's related to layout it's not. really related to rendering anything on. the screen. and this thing right here is also known. as a widget tree why. let's understand that so let's say we. have our material app so we have this. giant block of a thing which is called. material app so let's call this m. then in material app it has something. known as a scaffold then in scaffold we. have a center widget and in the center. widget we have. a text widget. so what have we got here. this is kind of like a tree right. because if you just take this and you. know. just reverse everything up. material app is the root of our widget. so material app sets the root for. everything. that's what we saw in the previous. diagram as well material art was setting. up everything in the global space then. we add scaffold which was one of the. branches then we add the center widget. which was one of the. branches branches you can say sub Branch. this was another sub Branch so we are. creating kind of like a tree that's why. this is known as a widget tree okay and. as I've already said before it's always. good to split up your widgets so what I. like to do is material app can have a. lot of configurations done inside it for. example routing can be set up in. material app theming can be set up in. material app and localization. internationalization and what not can be. set up in material app so this material. app can be filled pretty much so what I. like to do is take this scaffold because. it's a separate page of its own. and put it in a separate file in a. separate class of its own just like we. did with my app when it was in Run up. right. we just want to make sure that the. widget tree always stays small so that. it's easier to contribute to it and it's. easier to understand as well. so what I'll do is create a separate. file aware and the separate file is. going to be called let's say. currency. converter. material. page dot dot so you notice the. convention of naming aware of currency. then I wanted to put a space but if I. put a space it will be incorrect naming. so I have to put underscore over here so. we have currency underscore converter. underscore material underscore page dot. dot dot dot extension needs to be put. otherwise vs code can't identify. and even flutter cannot identify that. this is related to flutter so you need. to put the dot dot extension so vs code. automatically identifies hey this is a. DOT file. okay and we have created a new file over. here. in our lip folder itself. yeah. I can go ahead and create my stateless. widget again so I'll call this class. currency converter material. page I've given it a pretty long name. you can just call this. material home page I am putting material. over here because later on in our app. I'm going to show you the difference. between material and Cupertino app. right so not to cause any confusion I'm. putting this as currency converter. material page. however when we are building other apps. in the future I'll remove material. all together from my names because I. won't be experimenting with two type of. apps material and Cupertino I'm just. going to have one. design for my app which is material. design. because personally I like it much better. than Cupertino design. so if you have just one design guideline. which is being followed then you don't. have to name it like this. so anyways let's go ahead and extend. stateless widget we have already seen. this. and it automatically Imports. material.dot and one thing to note over. here is every time you import a new DOT. file you'll have to import a new. material.dot. because these import lines are specific. to the file if you have import. material.dot over here it doesn't mean. you can use. it over here. all the import lines are specific to. their files now I'll have to go ahead. and create an at the rate override. widget build then we have something. known as build context which we'll. understand. and then I'm going to return this thing. right here so I can just copy this and. go ahead and returns scaffold over here. also I'll need to put the key over here. so we'll have constant currency. converter material page. named argument. super dot key perfect. now I can take this class. come to the main.dot file remove the. scaffold and have. something like this done. so what I've done is basically. transferred my entire scaffold widget. from the home over here to a particular. specific widget of its own and now I can. keep building the widget tree over here. so this thing this my app class is much. shorter and I can pile up all my UI. related stuff related to the currency. converter page. in this particular widget and now if we. restart the app there will be no changes. at all because we have basically. transferred. everything in one class to another class. and then call that class so essentially. we are just having material app. scaffold Center text the same thing but. in different widgets. it's just for our improved visual or. improved working it doesn't have any. effect on the app till now okay. so I hope you've understood everything. till now if you have. amazing now again we can put Constable. whenever it asks us to let's resolve all. the errors we can put Constable here as. well save it and this looks good. now before moving forward I need you to. understand this build context thing. which is a very very important Concept. in flutter. after widget this is the second bigger. concept that I'm teaching you which is. build context so what exactly is this. build context here what does it do and. why is it mentioned inside this build. function. let's understand that build context is a. class provided by flutter which tells. the flutter framework that hey currency. converter material page is present over. here in the widget tree not anywhere. else it's basically telling the location. of this currency converter material page. in the entire widget tree and every time. you extend a stateless widget or a. stateful widget you will have access to. build context and every widget has that. if you press command and go to the. scaffold definition it extends something. known as a stateful widget and when we. scroll down. you'll see that this also has a build. context. and same goes for the center and this. text as well so every widget when. extended by a stateless stateful widget. will have its own build context because. flutter wants to know its location so. that's what build context does tells you. the location of a particular widget in. the widget tree. to understand this diagrammatically how. will flutter know. material app is present over here. scaffold is present over your Center and. text are present over here. how will Florida make sure that it. doesn't mess up stuff it doesn't mess up. stuff like Center is present over here. and text is present over here because we. need the rendering to be perfect right. if it is not perfect then our app will. look very different from what we want it. to look like. so that's where build context helps now. a valid question over here will be if. flutter can do all of this stuff behind. the scenes why is this build context. exposed to us like why do we have access. to build context of air why can't which. it build to be like this and this will. be nice right because we are not using. the build context anywhere in our code. well that's because we have not. implemented anything that's advanced yet. and when we do stuff like navigation. moving from one page to another setting. up the theme of our app all of that will. require build context. it is one of the most important Concepts. in flutter we'll understand the inner. workings of how navigation will take. place and all of that stuff but keep in. mind for now build context is basically. telling the location of the widget in. the widget tree also one thing that I. forgot to mention in the main.file if we. come and you see you're in a home we. have currency converter material page. instantiated over here. but this. is coming from package currency. converter currency converter material. page dot dot so as soon as we you know. instantiated it flutter automatically. imported this particular line. why let's break it down we have package. currency converter what is this package. currency converter well if you go to. your pubspect.yaml file scroll up you'll. see the name of your project as currency. converter. over here it's package flutter because. the name of the. flood up SDK is flutter. same way our package name is currency. converter that's why we have package. currency converter like this and in. there we have imported the currency. converter material page dot dot which is. present in the lib folder it doesn't go. like package currency converter slash. lib slash currency converter material. page dot dot because. yaml saying name it is obviously going. to be in the lib folder it's not going. to be anywhere else all your Dart files. are present in lib folder nowhere else. that's why it directly Imports it like. this however if you create a folder. inside of web let's say. pages so that it's more organized right. and then we shift it inside click on. move you can just drag and drop it and. then we do move extension dot wants to. make refactoring changes with this file. moves basically. since you've moved the file the import. lines will change now so Dart extension. will automatically do it for us so we. don't have to resolve those errors. now if we click on OK you see now its. package currency converter slash Pages. slash currency converter material page. dot dot. dot automatically did it for us and only. thing that we need to do is press Ctrl s. to save the changes made by the dot. extension all right so anything in the. lib folder will have its import like. this now this is called as package. importing now there's another type of. importing you can use here let's remove. this. and instead of importing it like package. currency converter what we can do is. relative importing by relative importing. it means whatever file we are in right. now in main.file. relative to this main.dot file where is. the file present. so relative to main.dot file we have dot. slash. and when you put dot slash you see auto. suggestions. so right now we are in the lib folder. all right because that's where main.dot. is present. then we need to go to the pages. folder so we'll just pass in dot slash. pages and there we have our currency. converter material page so this also. works and this is known as. relative importing because this is an. importing based on the current file so. if you are in main.dot file this is how. you will Traverse over it all right so. you can use either of them it depends on. your preference and it is also based on. the tools you use right many people. prefer importing like this but many. people don't prefer importing like this. but if you're coming from web. development you might have already seen. this in JavaScript code so it shouldn't. be too difficult for you however it. really depends on you whatever you want. to do. also when you remove this importing you. see the error comes over here because. this class is not identified this class. is not identified because it's coming. from some other file and we have not. imported that file that's why so to. resolve this again you can type it like. this or you can just do command full. stop so it will give you a list of fixes. that you can add in your app that will. fix this error so the Quick Fix is. importing the library set correctly I. identified that somewhere in our code. this currency converter material page. class is present so we can use that. and then it also has this different kind. of importing so both are importing but. it's just different kind of importing. now we can click over here save it and. then we are good to go also let's push. this file out in the lip folder again. let dot extension do its job we'll save. it and we'll delete the pages folder. because that was just for demo pages. will be required later on in our apps. when we build bigger apps right now we. just have two three pages what do you. want to do with that right so let's come. over here and now develop our app now. what is required in our app let's break. it down so how is our app going to look. like well first of all we have we are. going to have a big solid texture layer. which is bolded. which says hey this is your answer all. right. so this is the converted price and then. we have a simple text field which takes. the user input. and you can type your currency. over here. and then we have a button which says. convert. so we are going to have three elements. below one another present in our app. how do we make sure that happens. can we do it over here in the center. text widget can we put everything in a. text widget not really because there are. three different things paste out. differently so we have a text showing up. at the top then we have a text field and. then we have a button those are three. different widgets and you can't put. everything in a text widget what you. need to do is make sure that you have. some sort of widget that will make sure. you're able to align everything from top. to bottom. in a vertical manner. and it accepts many widgets. not just a single child widget like the. center has it needs to have children. because it will take in multiple widgets. it will take a text widget it will take. a text field widget and it will take. a button so we'll remove this text from. here and instead of putting a center. away what I'm going to do is put a. column. what is a column column is another. widget which doesn't really paint. anything on the screen it doesn't render. anything it's related to layout it's. basically laying out our widgets in a. certain Manner and how is it doing that. well it's a column right. how does column work it's something that. goes from top to bottom and it has an. argument of children if you scroll down. you'll see children and it doesn't. accept just a single widget it accepts a. list of widgets and we already know what. a list is. so let's go ahead and pass children away. then we are going to have our text. widget which says 0 for now okay so. let's save it and where did a zero go. it's not showing up anywhere. well that's because we have removed the. center widget from here. so again it starts right from the top. corner and that's why zero can't be seen. so a simple fix to this can be wrapping. column with Center widget again so let's. go ahead and have Center. child. then we'll take this column and paste it. over here. something like this all right. now if we come over here we can see our. zero but still it is centered. horizontally it's not really centered. vertically it's not coming over here. right it's over here. it's centered. in the horizontal space not in the. vertical space to so to center it in the. vertical space column has its own. properties as you can see over here it. has a property of main axis alignment. and it also has a property of cross axis. alignment we do know that it's something. related to alignment that we want. and. we have two alignment related properties. but which one should we use let's. understand the name main axis alignment. since this is a column what will the. mean axis of a column be the main axis. of a column is obviously the vertical. landscape right this is the main. axis and cross axis is this thing right. here. if we had something like a row. the opposite of a column the main axis. of a row will be the horizontal thing. and the cross axis will be. the vertical space but since this is a. column. column will have its main axis as the. vertical landscape or the vertical scape. and this will be horizontal which is. cross axis okay. so we'll go ahead and put main axis. alignment now what does Main axis want. and is it a class an enum what is it. so as you can see main axis alignment. has a preset value so if you don't pass. anything to main access alignment it has. the value of main access alignment dot. start what do we want we want Center and. as you can see we have suggestions. related to it already or if you just. pass main axis. alignment dot you'll still get all of. those values and as we know main access. alignment is an enum. so since it's an enum we have a bunch of. properties that we can select so it can. be Center that's what we want. but let's try other values first so that. we know what we're talking about then we. have end which is the opposite of start. right so instead of our 0 showing up. over here it's now showing up over here. if you can't see it. you see this is this part here this is 0. then we have space around space between. space evenly start now I won't be able. to show you the difference between space. around space between space evenly as of. now but when we add. two more widgets which are. the text field widget and button widgets. will understand the difference between. all of these three things so stay around. till that time and we'll understand the. difference but as of now we know what. start is we know what end is and. obviously Center is basically saying hey. come in the center. so since we've aligned this in the. center does it mean we can remove the. center widget like this and make sure. your. removing it nicely because when you try. to remove it. you know you have to remove this child. you have to remove the center. and then you also have to remove a. parenthesis related to it because this. is a center widget like this right. so make sure you remove it nicely or if. you can't remove it nicely then press. command shift r. or you can just right click. then go to. refactor. then you get a certain bunch of. properties over here and you see remove. this widget. so what this refactoring option does is. remove the current Widget the widget. that you had right clicked on from the. widget tree and when you do that. Boom the center widget is now gone and. there's only a column and we don't even. get an error so you can always do that. if you don't feel confident in removing. it now if we come over here again. r0 is gone but where is it gone it's. right over here. why is it over there because we had. removed the center widget which centered. the column horizontally not vertically. vertically we add main access alignment. so for horizontal. we have to put a center widget but. what's another thing that we can do well. I told you column has the cross access. alignment property as well which will. make sure. its position in the horizontal space. so we can just go ahead and add cross. access alignment then this requires. cross access alignment so we have cross. access alignment Dot and you see we have. a similar set of values we have Center. we have end we have start and we have. stretch so if we put. and you know where it will go we know it. where it will go right so if we come. over here well 0 is not over here it's. still over here why is that the case. that's the case because column will only. take up as much space as its children. want. it will not take anything more than that. which is why so column is only taking us. page this much long all right it's not. taking a space like this this entire. thing is not being taken only this much. is being taken. so that's why it cannot go over here. because column only has a space of this. much only till where the text is. if it had the entire space to itself. it could go over there. now if you still don't understand what. I'm going to do is wrap this column with. something known as a colored box which. will make sure that our column can have. some color. because column doesn't have a property. to give itself a color to give itself a. color to give to give column a color. we'll have to use a different widget we. cannot use column because column doesn't. have a color property of its own you can. check it over here so what I'm going to. do is have colored box over here which. is another widget provided by flutter. and you see we have color over here we. have to pass in a color. and we can also take this column and. pass it as the child so all of this is. very intuitive right because colored box. what will it do well it's simple English. it's a box that is colored so let's put. color over here but what's color well it. requires something known as a color so. let's put it over here and color might. be an enum but that's not the case color. is a class in itself and if you. instantiate it. it will tell you to give it some value. which is an integer. and. it requires something of this sort and. we really don't know what this is so we. can't use this this is not for people. like us so what can we use then well we. can go ahead and use some of the static. properties mentioned on this. color class. well we can use some of the methods over. here so we can use from argb from RGB of. alpha blend get Alpha from opacity love. but what is all of this well. from argb is basically telling that. provided Alpha red green blue color. values and then you'll be able to. display it from rgbo says that give me. the value of red green blue opacity and. then I'll be able to display it. why does it require only red green blue. because that's the fundamental colors. right those are the base colors based on. which other colors are made and RGB will. perfectly describe any color you want to. make. so let's go ahead and use from rgbo and. then we have to provide a set of values. from 0 to 255.. now we don't know any of these now what. is white color well we don't know. but we do know how to make a red color. because red green blue is going from 0. to 255 so I can give red the maximum. value then we have green blue and. opacity so if green is 0 blue is 0 and. opacity is 0 will that mean I'll get a. red color not really because. opacity basically means. how much part is visible and you're. saying it is 0 if it is 0 visible. then it is black color then there's. nothing there's black. that's why we are going to put one over. here which means it is completely. visible and now you can see in a preview. that we have selected the red color. again if you didn't understand since red. is given its maximum value which is 255. green and blue are given 0 and 0 values. and opacity is 1. that's why we get a red color now if we. save it come over here. you see this is what our column is it. doesn't extend to the entire screen it's. only this much right away here and. that's why when we put cross access. alignment dot end. it doesn't go till here because column. doesn't have this bigger space. remember what I told about text when. text was over here text can only go away. if the text widget takes that much space. now column can only take this much space. so it's. mentioned over here now in main access. alignment we could position it at the. top in the middle in this end. because column takes that much space but. column doesn't take the entire width. that's why. we cannot use cross access alignment. over here what we need to use is a. center widget and let's remove color. from here save it and then our widget is. centered right over here perfect. so that's good we are able to have a. column. with r0 written right over here. now the next thing I want to do is make. sure my zero is styled what did I say I. want my text to be bolded it should be. bigger in size. so I need these two things to happen now. how can I do that well we can find a. property inside of text because text. should have that right. if a text can't style itself what can a. text do and if we scroll down and find. something related to. bold and. font size we cannot find that. why. because it is all mentioned in one. single class which is the textile class. so we need to mention the style property. put in a textile. where font size. font to it all of those things are. present so we can go ahead and have. style then we'll pass textile over here. that's called. and now if you hover over textile you. see a bunch of properties related to. styling of the text we have color. we have font size that's what we are. looking for we also have background. color of the text and a lot lot more. things. this is why. all the styling related to text is. present in textile since there are so. many properties you cannot just put it. in a text widget it will be two occupied. over here that's why just put everything. in a. textile class encapsulate it in text. style class and textile can be used. inside of the text widget. so that was the decision making the. flood attempt team took and it's clearly. pretty good. so now we can put in font size over here. let's say font size is 20 because this. requires a value of double. and save it if we come over here the. font size has increased but it's not. increased that much so let's go ahead. with 25 save it come over here and it is. much bigger still not appealing to me so. I'm just going to go ahead and put 35.. this looks nice. now you have to keep testing to see. which font size you prefer the default. font size is 14 so if you put 14 where. it will come back to normal or if you. don't mention it at all it will be 14. but when you do mention it let's go. ahead with 45 I think that would be good. yeah. and the next thing I want to do is bold. it so for building what can I use well. there's nothing related to Bolding that. we can see over here but we do have font. weight. what is font weight well font weight is. basically how much weight the font has. how much bold it is so we have found. weight dot boldavia fontway dot normal. and you see font weight requires. something known as a font to it and font. weight is a class with all of those. properties mentioned over here. so we can put font to it. dot normal which is the default one. or we can use W 400 W 500 you can keep. testing on your own but I'm going to go. ahead with the Bold option because. that's what I want I'll save it and you. see this is bolded now if you want to. see it real time I can do it over here. I'll remove this save it. the Bold is gone now I'll put it back by. pressing command set and save it yep now. it is bolded so you can see this works. and also if I put W 700 and save it. there will be no visible difference. because behind the scenes dot bold is. using W 700 weight. and if I put W 400. it will come back to normal because. normal. is using W 400 you can see it over here. now if you want something Bolder than. the normal bolded you can go ahead with. W 800. or W 900 and that will keep it very. bolded but I'll go ahead with the. default bold option that we have and. this looks better. great now if you again want to increase. its size you can do it depending on your. preference. good so now we have our text displaying. as. and how we want it. now again if you want to change the. color of this text you can do it so you. can pass a color over here and color can. be color dot from. argb now what is argb argb is basically. Alpha value. which is kind of like opacity but. instead of 0 to 1 this extends from 0 to. 255 so 255 is. fully visible and 0 is not visible. then we have red green blue just like 0. to 255 0 to 255 0 to 255.. and also if you just go on Google and. type white RGB. you'll see. the RGB the red green and blue values of. the white color. so for white it's 255 255 and 255 so you. can just go ahead and pass 255. 255 255 and the alpha value is 1 so that. will make. it white color not exactly because we. have put one over here in the alpha. alpha requires a value of 255 and you. see we get a wider value over here. now if we come we are not able to see it. very properly but you can see it. there's a white color over here now if. you're confused that why is this white. visible on a white background that's. because this background color of. scaffold is. not pure white. it is white but with a different RGB. value this white over here is pure white. that's why we can see it and if you want. to change the background color of a. scaffold you can do it so you can come. to the scaffold search for a property. over here related to color. and you'll see background color over. here where you can pass let's say a. black color so for black you can pass in. color dot from rgbo. zero zero zero. and one why zero zero zero because when. red green blue r0 that means none of the. colors are present that's when black. will be made right black is basically. nothing no colors. and now if you see we have a black color. and a white colored text is visibly seen. over here now you might be having a. question that hey why does flutter make. it so complicated to just put a value to. put a right. color why can't I just. name it well you can instead of using. the color class you can use the colors. class. and then you will have access to. a bunch of colors that you can directly. mention you don't have to mention there. rgba values. so if you want to put green over here. you can save it then and you see this is. green color with white text and. obviously you need to put comma before. mentioning any other property otherwise. it will give you an error because at the. end of the day this is a class that is. being instantiated right and in a class. when you mention a property you need to. put a comma to separate it now you can. go ahead and test other colors so you. can have light blue and there are many. many colors but the reason color dot. from RGB is present because colors dot. cannot mention every possible color. because there are infinite colors right. you can make infinite combinations. not infinite I mean uncountable. combinations so to give you more access. to what color you want we have from argb. and rgbo which tell you to specify the. color on your own and. make sure that your background color or. any color is. the way you want it to be. so we can for now go ahead and type. colors Dot. blue gray save it. and this looks fine we can keep it or we. can just keep the white color. anything you prefer I would prefer. making the app more visual as of now. later on we'll get to the minimalistic. designs all right so now we have covered. the text widget as well in a column now. time to put other widgets in the column. before this we have never put any other. widget inside of One widget so every. widget requires only one child but in. column we have children that's why I can. mention. another widget and what is the other. widget well it's the text field widget. which will allow me to take the user. input and now if I just instantiate it. like this save it I get text field over. here and I can type anything in this. text field right but obviously this is. not what our text field should look like. because text fields are meant to be more. visual. you know I don't know what this text. field is for. it doesn't give me any clue as to what I. need to type in over here and also the. design is looking pretty bad so let's. change it by adding some designs in this. text field so let's go over all the. stuff we need to add in the text field. so if we come over here the first thing. that I want to add is basically kind of. like a hint saying that hey this is the. thing you need to add it's not a. placeholder but it's basically something. written over here and. it should show up only when I haven't. typed anything over here. and when I start typing a number I. should be seeing it so how can I make. sure that kind of hint comes up. so for that I'll have to look at the. properties and see if there's a property. related to it and there's something. known as style and stood style but if. you see style takes up. value of textile if it takes a value of. textiles then it's probably related to. text and this is a text field right so. this style isn't related to the style of. the text feed it's related to the text. inside the text field. so if we just try to edit it out so. we'll type your style text style and. let's say we change the color to. colors.blue all right and then we save. it and then if I type anything you see. instead of black color I get. blue color so this isn't related to the. text field style because this is textile. textile is always related to the style. of the text. so from Context we can understand that. this isn't what we want. although we can convert it to White. because the black color over here used. to look bad. then we can go ahead and look for. something else. and the thing we are looking for is. not mentioned anywhere over here. is it. well it is if you see a layer we have a. property called decoration which handles. all the decoration related stuff in a. text field and if you see it requires a. type of input decoration and the default. value of it is. input decoration with nothing mentioned. inside of it so we can just go ahead and. add input decoration. and now input decoration has a lot of. configurations you can do why again it. is similar to the textile textile. encapsulated all the. properties related to a text styling. which we can use anywhere outside of. text also right so text. style could be used over your textile. can be used over here as well in a text. field so similarly decoration is there. where it requires input decoration and. we can pass anything to an input. decoration which encapsulates a lot of. properties. there's icon icon color label label text. and many more things so let's go ahead. with label because this looks something. we would want and this label requires a. widget. so we can pass let's say a text saying. please enter the amount in INR because I. am building a currency converter which. changes the amount from INR to let's say. USD all right or we can do the reverse. USD to INR okay and now if we see over. here we have everything showing up in. blue color. and when I restart the app. we see please enter the amount in USD. over here written in black and when I. click over here it goes right at the top. in blue color. it's not really legible but. yeah this is what label is. let's go ahead and make some changes. first of all I want this to show up in. white color so what I can do is style. textile then I'll pass color to it and. the color will be colors dot why again. then we can save it and we come over. here it's now written in white color so. we can see it in white color now if I. click over here again this is white. perfect but is that what we want I don't. want it to be like this for example if I. restart the app. I don't want this label to be present. over here when I click over here the. label should. start disappearing you know when I type. anything this label shouldn't be there. right at the top because it doesn't look. good it's not a small word that can stay. away it's kind of like a big sentence. and it doesn't look good here so it's. definitely label is not what we want as. of now later on maybe in some part of. your app you can use it but label is not. what we want over here. then let's look at other properties that. might help us label text here we just. need to pass in a string instead of the. entire widget now you might ask why do. we have these two different. properties over here that's because. label. requires a widget and you can literally. pass any widget to it it's not. necessarily a text that you need to pass. in it can be anything but with label. text you need to pass in a string. otherwise you don't have to pass. anything so that's the difference with. label you get more customizable options. with label text you don't get those. customizable options however in our case. we could have used label texture then we. had something like this let's remove the. text. and only a string over here and when I. come. we are back to normal we don't have any. white color or anything. so to add the white color we could go. ahead and use label style which requires. textile. so instead of using a text widget we use. two properties over here and it would. result in the same output. okay then this is all floating label all. of that stuff basically how do you want. your label to look when it's over here. floating in the air right. then you have helper text let's go ahead. and replace. label with helper text and see what it. does and here you see it says please. enter the amount in USD below it doesn't. give me a label kind of thing and when. we restart it's the same thing just. mentioned over here so that it could. give us a. hint or kind of like help us to know. what is to be done over here but still. this doesn't look good for our use case. so let's find something else then all of. those to helper style related stuff is. there. and then we have the error text so. whenever you have an error related to a. text field what should the error show. and how should it be shown. all of that is written over here again. not what we want then we have prefix. icon which we'll get to after we are. we've added the right text that we want. and the right text we are looking for is. hint text all right. I'll tell it to you right away otherwise. we'll be scrolling through a bunch of. properties given to us by flutter so. that we have full control over the UI. which is a good thing. okay now let's come back here put a hand. text and then we have please enter the. amount in USD save it and we have it. over here. when I click. it doesn't go at the top it's not. floating anymore it's just there and. when I start to type it disappears and. when I come back to normal when there's. no text again it gives us a hint of what. has to be mentioned we can also. configure the Style again and then pass. in textile and then we need to have a. color let's say colors is colors dot why. save it. come back over here and this might look. good or this might not let's try a. different shade aware so we have white. and then a bunch of different shades. related to white white 10 white 12s why. 24 and so on let's go ahead and drive by. 38 save it it's kind of like gray but I. don't like it that much maybe White. not 12 white 60. I think I'll go ahead with this. it's not exactly White. so the entire focus is not over here. but it does its decent job good enough. and now you might have noticed that when. I don't put commas between all of these. properties the formatting of the text or. the code goes wrong for example when I. put a comma here and Save. there's a good formatting done however. when I remove the comma. all of these brackets come together so. comma helps with indentation and. formatting in our code by indentation I. mean. you see how bodies written over here. then their Center then there's a gap. this Gap is known as indentation. this helps us to know what kind of. widget tree we are in for example this. columns children all have are in the. same line all right but the center. has its own line over here these lines. can help us to know where. we are in the widget tree and that will. help us a lot. when we especially work on bigger apps. also you can see these comments right. over here which tell you that hey this. is the end of the textile this is the. end of the input decoration this is the. end of text field this allows you to. quickly know where you are in your code. and add stuff quickly. so we have our text field over here. that's good now what I want is. an icon over here that says you know. a money icon kind of thing. so it's like a dollar that shows that. hey you need to enter the amount here. so that people who don't know English. can follow along what they need to do. so here in our input decoration itself. we have a property where that we saw. prefix icon right. so if we type prefix there are a lot of. prefix stuff prefix which requires a. widget prefix icon which also requires a. widget then prefix icon color prefix. icon constraints prefix style and prefix. text so prefix text is you know what if. we just pass string over here. and let's say hello. save it you see prefix text is the text. that shows up before. the normal hint that you have and also. when you type something. the prefix icon stays there but the hint. goes away. and a cursor also starts after the. prefix icon or the prefix text. but prefix text is not what we want what. we want is prefix icon or prefix. touch it. so we can go ahead and use prefix. but here what will a prefix be I need to. add an icon over here how do I add an. icon. is there a widget for it yup which is. icon. icon is another widget if you press. command you'll go in the source code. class icon extends stateless widget. so you can add your icon over here but. the icon requires a positional argument. of Icon data. what is this icon data well let's pass. it I can data and when you initialize. this it asks you for some code point. and this code point is basically used to. create what kind of Icon you want now. you can ask your AI assistant. to create some code point for you but we. are not going to do that because I. myself don't understand most of the. stuff inside. of eichen data. like there's font family which you can. easily understand font package but what. is code point and how do you figure it. out right so let's ignore that icon data. is not meant for people like us. it's for advanced developers and if you. want to become one you can just go ahead. and Google about it. however what we can do here is pass. icons. why because if you click over here with. command. abstract final class icons can be put. inside of an icon widget. and with this icons class we have a lot. of material icons. you can see all of them over here. and when you click on this Arrow right. here not anywhere else just the icon. you'll be able to see the icon preview. so we have ABC ABC outline ABC rounded. and a lot more stuff you can just go. ahead and see what you want I want a. dollar sign is there something related. to a dollar sign not really so we can. skip this let's go back and try. something new so we have icons Dot Money. related stuff. yup money is there then there's money. off and money off is a dollar symbol. with Slash on it so maybe money. underscore on is there without a slash. symbol but that's not the case clearly. so we cannot use anything like that. so. you need to experiment over here to find. your icon otherwise. you can just go ahead and Google stuff. but if I just do icons dot monetization. on I see this dollar sign now if I put. monetization on outline I get it just. outline then rounded then Sharp then. there's money so let's go ahead and see. what all is there in modernization and. this is all that's there so we're going. to go ahead and use this also put a. comma so that formatting is there. cool so. a comma is required. before every. property mentioned inside a class. but it's not required when you have like. multiple parenthesis. together okay. so you can have it like this but. obviously Comma just makes stuff better. and it's more readable code. so let's see if this come over here we. have our dollar symbol showing up which. is nice now instead of using prefix what. I'll do is go ahead and use prefix icon. to see the difference and you see prefix. icon properly places it like a icon. because this. prefix. requires a widget and you see prefix. icon does the proper job of putting an. icon before it so it leaves some margin. from here you can see there was a lot of. spacing added then this icon was. properly placed in the text field not. above or below and took the default. theme of our app which was the blue. color. so I can obviously go ahead and change. the prefix icon color this requires to. be a type of color so I can just have. colors dot maybe black not black let's. go ahead with white again. yep. and if you want you can just make this. outline so you get an outline icon over. here perfect and if you want to match. the color present over here and color. for the icon you can do that so let's. copy it and paste it like this save it. and this looks better because both of. these things are merging with each other. you know. good stuff now instead. now what if instead of I adding my icon. over here I want to add it right at the. end what should I do then so for that we. have similar properties called suffix. suffix icon and all of that stuff. same things so suffix will make sure. your icon is over here and suffix I can. will properly place it. then we can put suffix I can color. instead of suffix icon. and then you know you get the same. things so instead of adding the icon in. the left hand side you have the icon now. in the right hand side. so it's. prefix and suffix right but. but in our app it doesn't make sense to. put the icon over here so let's shift it. in the left hand side. let's put prefix icon here I'm just. pressing command set to go back then I. can have prefix icon and prefix icon. color this looks good. now the next thing that I want is my. text field to be colored. I don't want it to be transparent like. here I want it to take a white proper. color. so for that I'll have to go ahead and. add another property which is. let's find it. and we see a property here which is. Boolean filled color filled color color. Focus color color hover color so let's. go ahead and pass fill color and our. color is going to be colors.white let's. save it and we don't see any changes. maybe we need to hot restart so when we. hot restart we still don't see anything. why is that the case. well that's case because you've. mentioned the fill color. and it says that is the base fill color. of the decorations container color now. maybe you don't understand it but it. basically is the right property to color. it but before fill color we need to add. filled set it to true and then only we. see the white background. right now this looks good. does it. but now since we've made it white. everything has disappeared from here all. the white 60 and all of them have gone. so maybe we can shift them to Black. so I'll change the icon and the text to. Black again and we see the right thing. now this looks much better however if. you just zoom in or I'll just zoom in. for you by taking a screenshot to take a. screenshot on the screen you can press. command s. so you basically save the screenshot now. I've taken a screenshot and when I zoom. in you'll see there is a blue background. over here. not a blue background you can see but a. blue border color. now how do you remove that blue. background color and you know replace it. with something you want in my case. I'll be happy if it is this color the. background color of the scaffold or just. a white color so that it merges with all. of that stuff. so let's look for something border. related in our input decoration. and we do have a bunch of properties. just related to a border let's go over. them so if I put in Border there's a. border property. but we don't have to be concerned with. that I'm just going to skip that one and. we are going to focus on. the focused border why because Focus. border is a border that displays when. the input decorator has a focus and is. not showing an error. so what is that thing well. right now my border or my input or my. text field is not focused when I click. over here there is a blue border that. shows up correct. that is focused border so I just need to. use that so I can just have focused. border. and then I can pass an outline input. border then I can just pass an input. border the thing that it requires so. I'll just go ahead and pass it in over. here but as you can see it gives me an. error saying abstract classes cannot be. instantiated try creating an instance of. a concrete subtype basically input. border is an abstract class. so I cannot use that. so let's remove that and find a class. that basically inherits from input. border so basically extending from input. border so you need can type input border. and we do see two type of classes here. outline input border and underline input. border let's go ahead and use outline. input border first then save it. and now if you see the color of when it. is in Focus has changed it has changed a. little bit right. if I just restart the app again I click. over here you see it kind of enlarges. and then there's a thick black border. showing instead of a blue border why. let's take a look at the properties of. outline input body to understand that. there's Border Side border radius and. GAP padding let's take a look at Border. Side so if I pass in Border Side. it requires a type of Border Side so I. can just go ahead and use Border Side. and when I go overboard aside this class. has its own bunch of properties it has. color width style and stroke align so. the first one is color which has. constant color of 0 xff and six zeros. so how do we understand what color this. is. to understand that let's understand the. format the colors are in. so every color in. flutter. has a type which is like 0x. aarr GG BB so first you need to mention. 0x then you need to mention that Alpha. values. then the red value then the green value. then the blue value. so here we have. 0 x f f zero zero zero zero zero so. that's 0x then Alpha is FF then we have. two values for r two numbers for G and. two numbers for B that means. we have RGB of 0 0 0 that means we have. a black color and that is why we have a. black color showing up over here since. the default color of. the Border Side is 0x and when we first. create an. outline input border by default it. creates a Border Side instance that is. why. the color is default by black but we can. change it so let's go ahead and change. it we have colors dot let's say. White. or colors.red let's go ahead with. colors.red. then we come over here and there's a red. color showing up now the red color is. quite small right so I can increase its. width so I can pass the width as let's. say 10.0 come over here and here it is a. massive width over here. now I don't want that much let's put it. out to. and this looks better. then we have style so what style of the. Border do you want. and this requires a type of Border style. so you can have border style dot none or. solid. so let's have border style dot none. and then there is no border at all. but if I put solid it puts a solid thick. line here. and then there's stroke align which has. a value of stroke align inside. so we have stroke align but stroke align. requires a double value how can you pass. in stroke a line inside well that's. because stroke. a line inside is a property mentioned. inside of Border Side itself so we have. Border Side Dot strokaline Center border. sites dot stroke align inside and Border. Side dot stroke align outside. that is why in stroke align you see. stroke align inside however when you. jump inside here. stroke align inside is a value. stroke align Center is also a value and. stroker line outside is also a value. this is negative one this is 0 and this. is one displaying where you want it do. you want the border to be inside in the. center or outside. let's take a screenshot of this emulator. to understand it better to take a. screenshot you just have to press. command s and that will take it. and then when you scroll inside you'll. see that this is the part where. our text field is ending and our border. is displaying inside if I want it right. in the center or outside where the text. field. gets over I can do that. so I can just have Border Side Dot. stroke align inside stroker line outside. let's put stroker line outside. and you see the difference. now it is at the outside it doesn't feel. inside now this is a very minor change. but it does affect the UI a little bit. let's put some commas and there we go. now I'm just going to remove red because. red doesn't look good I'll just put. black because black looks solid. and now let's exit this because I wanted. it outside and that's good. or maybe we don't want it outside we can. keep it inside perfect now the next. thing is whenever I type something it. shows up in white color so I need to. change it to Black again so I can just. have the. style over here the text style which is. related to what the user enters to. colors.black and now when I type. anything it looks good perfect the next. thing that you might want in your text. field input is. this thing right here is slightly curved. you want it completely curved like it. shouldn't look very rectangle it should. look something like this right so if you. want that kind of text field you can. change that by editing one property. which is the Border radius so you can. pass border radius over here and Border. radius requires a type of Border radius. so you can have border. radius. but if you do this much it's not allowed. because border radius if you go over. there doesn't allow you to go. because border radius has a Constructor. that is private however when I remove. the instantiation I only have a type of. Border radius so I can click and go over. there but if you see border radius. Constructor is not present at all a. class of water radius is present but. there's nothing related to Bod radius. Constructor also you'll see some new. stuff over here you have border radius. dot all. and that is not a static method why. because it's named after border radius. and Border radius is. the name of the class so that means it. is a Constructor and this is a named. Constructor not the named argument. Constructor but the Constructor has its. own name that you can use. so we are going to use exactly that we. are going to have border radius Dot and. it has a lot of stuff 0 which basically. eliminates the entire border radius now. you see the curve is gone it is a. perfect rectangle but that's not what we. want we want border radius dot all so in. all the directions of your text field. what border radius you need to put in. horizontal so from the left hand the. right side what you want only so from. top left side from top right side. what you want. so horizontal basically allows you to. have a little bit more customization. than all and only has full control over. your entire text field. then you have vertical so you have top. and bottom circular so you want to. create a border radius where everything. looks circular. and then you have look which is linearly. interpolating between two border radius. objects but you don't need to care about. it that much. you can get most of your stuff done with. these five things. let's go ahead and try border radius dot. all 10 and then save it but if we do. this we get an error why because this. requires a type of radius not an integer. so we need to remove this and pass. radius. and it's a positional argument so you. can just pass in radius. and again radius Constructor is not. defined you have to use radius dot. something. so always whenever you want to figure. something out because obviously you'll. find out later on that there are so many. widgets you won't know everything about. them but you can always know what all. properties they need and it's in very. English language there's nothing. very UI related language that's. mentioned over here that you can't. understand so you can just figure out by. doing this radius but it doesn't. resolve the error because its. Constructor doesn't exist so let's try. to do something with radius Dot. and yeah we do get options for that and. you see here we have image descriptions. for it. what is circular what is elliptical what. is love but we are just going to go. ahead with radius dot circular and pass. in 10 which is what circular requires a. Double Radius value. then save it. become aware and this is more rounded. but we can make it more rounded by. having 40 and you see this is proper. input that one might require. then we can also pass in 60. and this. makes it even more circular. so you get the point now let's try. something else we have border radius Dot. horizontal and from the left side we are. going to have radius dot circular 60. okay let's see what happens you see. from the left hand side there is this. radius but on the right hand side it's. strictly edgy. and if we do it for right we have right. dot circular like this so this is pointy. a perfect rectangle and then we have. Circle over here. so you can create a bunch of things like. this with horizontal with vertical in. vertical you have to mention top or. bottom you can pass in top. and it's something like this then you. have bottom. where you have something like this so. you can try a lot of stuff and maybe it. looks cool sometime maybe it doesn't but. I'm just going to go ahead. with. border radius.all because. that's better in my opinion a standard. way now you can also try to put. only here and go ahead and configure. everything from top left top right and. everything but you get the point I'm not. going to dive much into this now. and now finally if we try circular. circular gives us an error because. circular doesn't require radius it. requires a double value. so let's remove this and put 60. is that. fine. not really it's giving us an error why. we have put a double value right. well that's because if we go to the. circular part. every Constructor here has a const. constant border radius dot all constant. border radius dot vertical constant. border radius dot horizontal but. it's not border radius dot circular with. a constant it's just border radius dot. circular. that's why this isn't a constant. Constructor. and right at the top we have mentioned. return constant scaffold since we have. returned constant scaffold all of its. widgets need to be constant like Center. was a constant and column was a constant. and likewise even text and textile text. field textile everything was a constant. but finally we have something which is. not a constant. so what do we need to do we just need to. remove a constant scaffold from here. put a constant text put constant textile. put constant textile over here put. constant Border Side and that's all. our error gets fixed and we need to put. constant for every single widget which. is a const. but since this wasn't a const. We cannot put constant over here or on. any widget here if we put constant aware. that won't be allowed. We cannot put constant on any parent. widget. for Border radius the parent widget will. be Border Side outline input border not. border side only out or outline input. border. input decoration. text field. column Center and scaffold. so you can't put constant on any of its. parents widget. parent widget. is whatever widget border radius is in. and it's in. outline input border input decoration. text field and stuff like that okay. so I hope you understood that we are. going to know more about constant and. why it's required after we have built a. successfully working application. but for now just follow along and use. constant every time. now if we come over here. it's the same output border radius dot. circular 60 has the same output as. borders hook radius dot all. radius dot circular. 60. all right. because at the end of the day we are. just saying. from all the edges you want to put. a radius that is circular which is 60. and Border radius dot circular also says. that from all the edges you want to put. circular. which is 60. okay so it's the same thing. however I don't want any of that. or maybe I do want border radius dot. Circle let's say n. or maybe. 5. and that will be good enough for me and. we are pretty much done with everything. but if you see one thing when we restart. our app we have our text field looking a. bit weird and when we click over it it. enlarges and it just feels very weird. you know so what I want to do is make. our text field look like this from the. start okay when I click over here when I. have the focus. and when I don't have the focus it. should look the same thing so for that. we have a different border property. which is. enabled border. when I put enabled border it also. requires the same thing input border. and since input border is an abstract. class I cannot use it but I can use. underline input or outline input what is. underline input underlined input if we. just instantiated and restart our app we. can't see anything visible but if we. take a screenshot come aware and zoom in. you'll see there's a border only in the. bottom there's no border at the top. there's a border only in the bottom. which is black which is what underline. input border is instead of having. borders everywhere like you have an. outline input border you just have an. underline border. and then you have board properties. related to it which is Border Side which. we've already looked at over here. then it has border radius. which we already saw and that's it no. further customization so that's not what. we want what we want is this outline. input border so I can just grab this. press command C to copy it and paste it. over here also put a comma so that. formatting works and when we come over. here you see when I click over here and. when I don't collect it's the same thing. but yeah this makes my widget look very. big so what I can do instead is. in my build function itself I'll create. final. border. which is equal to. this outline input border that I just. saved. so at the end of the day this is a. function right and in a function I can. create my own variable which I've. created over here I've created a border. variable and assigned it a value of. outline input border if I hover over it. dot currently correctly recognizes it. now I can take this border and paste it. over here. I can take this border and paste it over. here. what this does is reduce the complexity. inside my input decoration. because I'm not writing big big stuff. here which are the same thing and also. whenever I want to change anything I can. do it one place if I had two different. instances over here and maybe I wanted. my border style to have a width of 10. then it would be weird why because right. now it looks normal when I click over it. it looks very weird. because I changed the stuff. in my focus border but I didn't change. it in the enabled border I also need to. change it over here right and then when. I start it it feels the same thing. so what I've done instead is. created a variable border here then took. this border. pasted it over here pasted it over here. and then whenever I want to change. something I can just do it at one place. and it correctly changes right. so I hope you understood that and this. is a build function this is a function. where I can create any variable that I. want and I've created it over here I can. also create it over here in my class but. it has some problems. because this is a cons Constructor I've. used body radius dot circular. so I'll have to remove constant from. here for it to work. and we've already seen that const has. performance benefits. so you should not remove it from The. Constructor of a widget at least as much. as you can. and we can avoid it by putting this in. the build function so why not but yeah. one thing to note is don't put. any complex task inside of this build. function yeah you can put variables and. you can put functions that are not. expensive that means that they are not. doing big big stuff like putting an. asynchronous thing over here or putting. a timer. nothing like that needs to be done in. build function build function should. have. a widget tree that is to be returned and. maybe if you want you can put. variables over here. okay perfect so my text field looks good. okay let me change my width back to. 2.0. yeah so we are done with the text field. and we have taken a look at a lot of. text Field properties there are still a. lot more that we can cover. but. let's not get into them so the design. for the text field looks good enough I. think we can exit from here. but there's still two more things that I. want to fix first one is this text field. being too much in the corners all right. I want some spacing to be there from. here from here all right from the left. and the right hand side and another. thing is when I press command K while. being on the text field. we get our. keyboard here. okay when I press command key I get. access to the keyboard. if you're on Android emulator. keyboard is constantly there on the. Android emulator. you see our keyboard allows us to put. text related stuff here I don't want. that I want to restrict it to numbers. only you shouldn't be seeing text. you should only be seeing. numbers here. so let's go ahead and put. a property that will make sure. text field doesn't allow you to put. text. only numbers. so that property is not mentioned in. input decoration input decoration is. related to how you want to design and. decorate your text field but this is not. related to designing the text field it's. related to one of the properties or. functionalities of text field so we can. click over here. foreign. type we want to change the keyboard only. right so we have keyboard type here. which we can change so let's go out of. the input decoration. and pass in keyboard type and this. requires a type of text input type so we. can go ahead and mention text input type. Dot and this is an e and this is a class. that allows us to put multiple things so. we have text input type dot date time so. if you only want date related stuff. and you can see on iOS it requests the. default keyboard but on Android it. requests a keyboard with ready access to. this because iOS doesn't have an Android. style keyboard and iOS doesn't have and. Android doesn't have IOS style keyboard. obviously so let's go ahead and see what. we want we want number so we can have. number and. we restarted. we click over here and we see only. numbers that's good right. however the problem over here is yeah I. cannot put. text but I cannot also put decimal. points I want decimal points so let's. find something else so we love. number phone street address but we also. have number with options so this allows. us to put a decimal point. if I save this much and restart the app. come over here. no changes however. I do have two named properties that I. can configure decimal and signed if I. put decimal. set it to True save it. again we need to restart. come aware. we have a nice decimal point showing up. over here 8.0. and if you want you can also set signed. to True which allows you to put negative. sign again we'll have to restart. come aware. and you see. we get all of those stuff. so basically we get all the alphabets. and everything but our keyboard starts. with showing a number. but that's not what I want so I'll just. set decimal to true and set this as. constant because this has a constant. Constructor. so yeah. let's restart the app and there we go. perfect. now. the second thing that I wanted is the. padding over here or the margin to be. left from the left side and the right. hand side some spacing needs to be there. but I cannot do that by using one of the. properties of text field why because. text field doesn't have those properties. it doesn't have anything related to. margin padding all of that stuff but. that's not the case it does have. something related to padding which is. scroll padding and if we see in. decoration because. we are decorating the text field only we. have content padding but those are. two things that are related with inside. of the text field with content batting. basically you can set padding. such that you can leave space from here. you can make sure that your text field. looks bigger and this text has. more padding to it. so this text field will appear stretched. but that's not what we want. and the scroll padding is nowhere. related to what we want. it configures a padding to edges. surrounding a scroll level when the text. field Scrolls into view nothing that we. care about so we can exit this so text. field is not giving us any property and. rightly so how can text field give us a. property related to the outside. for that we'll again have to wrap our. text field with other widget. and what is that widget well it can be. padding or container widget. let's take a look at both of those. widget padding. and container. so I'm just going to wrap my text field. with the padding widget and for that I. don't have to write padding and all of. that stuff what I can do is press Ctrl. shift r. which brings up a set of. refactoring options or you can just. press. right click refactor and then you have. access to the refactoring option and. here you can wrap with the widget you. can wrap with a builder other widgets. that are present. and then you also have container and. padding so let's wrap it with padding. and you see there's padding then the. padding property and then a child so it. correctly configures itself so we don't. have to do much task with it then we. save it. and then there's padding. so what's happening over here is this. text field text field usually takes up. the entire width of the device or the. entire width that it's given. but here you are restricting it to take. the entire width that is. provided by adding padding and padding. is the amount of space by which to. insert the child. so basically. text field has a habit of taking the. entire screen you're saying that hey you. cannot take the entire screen. and you're restricting it. by putting a padding widget which. eliminates 8 pixels of screen size and. also padding requires something known as. agencies geometry but if you just do. Edge in sets geometry. it won't allow you because. it is an abstract class. but Edge in such. extends its agent's geometry so you can. use it over here now you see how the. entire flood of framework is built on. the concept of inheritance encapsulation. all the object oriented programming. Concepts that we learned about. but anyways this is good and I think. this is a nice start. agencies dot all eight is quite good. over here and it looks good however. there are more properties on edge. instance that you can take a look at. agentsets dot all agencies Dot from ltrb. which is from left top right bottom. then you need to mention all of those. things then you have Dot from view. padding so you can set a padding based. on The View padding then we have only so. you can set left upright bottom. now you might ask what's the difference. between from ltrb and only well the. difference is all the properties inside. of only are optional. you can pass them and you cannot pass. them it's fine if you only want to pass. left you can pass it and you'll be good. right. but on the other hand when you have from. ltrb you necessarily need to mention all. of those parameters you need to mention. left top right bottom values you cannot. skip any one of them. or you can just pass in zero but yeah. this is just more customization added. for you but we are just going to go. ahead with only. not all why not all. because when we leave live with all you. live by leave padding from your from. Year from year and from bottom as well. when we add a button you'll see that. but with. only. already. symmetric where you need to mention the. horizontal and vertical values. you can leave spacing from year and year. or from year and year. so you need to set for vertical together. and from horizontal together that means. if I pass in horizontal 10 and save it. from left I'm leaving 10 pixels from. right I'm leaving 10 pixels. but from top and bottom I'm leaving 0. pixel that's how it works and I think. you're smart enough to figure it out on. your own. we are going to go ahead with let's say. agencies dot all 10. because. we need to leave some space from here. and we need to leave space from below. when our button comes along. great this looks good. now instead of using padding you can. also use container so if I use container. instead of padding. it all works fine why because container. allows you to set a bunch of properties. it has alignment padding color. decoration width height so it's like a. one and all widget right. it allows you to set multiple properties. and if you just. command click on container and just go. to its build function. you'll notice that. container is itself made up of multiple. other widgets like you might have seen. the agent says geometry the padding. widget so whenever we set the padding. over here in our container you're. basically using the padding widget only. then we have the color where we are. using colored box. and when you see margin. or constraints it is using a bunch of. other widgets is what I'm saying. now here you can set padding or margin. now what is the difference between. padding and margin. to understand that let's take a look at. the diagram. if I just remove this. will be able to draw something so let's. say we have a screen like this maybe a. better screen okay. now. this is where my app resides. so this is my text that is displaying. okay. so I have my text over here. now the spacing between the. text and this container box is known as. padding all right. this thing right here is padding but. this thing right here is margin. so to explain it in a short sentence. margin is related to stuff outside your. container. and padding is related to stuff inside. your container. but in this case the padding and margin. will be the same thing so if we save it. our text field decreases even further. but in certain scenarios you'll see. containers padding and margin property. behaving differently especially when we. have a container with a text inside of. it. and maybe you can check it out over here. how let's press command shift R then you. have wrap with container property. and your you know you can just pass in a. child then in the container you can. first of all set. the padding property which is going to. be constant Edge in such whenever you. have padding or margin related stuff you. need to use Edge and sets then you have. agencies.all 10 then you have margin of. agencies.all 10 again this is going to. be constant and then you can set a color. property and the color is going to be. colors.black okay let's save it come. over here. you see first thing to note is the. container takes only as much space. the font requires it doesn't take the. entire width of the screen like the text. field does. it only takes as much space as it. as its child requires. only as much space as this text requires. if I reduce its font size to 1 it will. take only this much space if I increase. its font size it will take as much space. as this text requires even column did. the same thing right we have seen that. earlier container does the same thing. so basically the child is determining. how much the height and width of the. container should be unless I. specifically go ahead here and type. height should be 400 which should be 299. okay then it doesn't follow the. constraints or the sizing of text it. takes the entire space however I'm not. doing that. because here I want to achieve a. different purpose as you can see over. here. there's some sort of padding over here. however when I remove this. the container is squashed even further. right with this padding I am determining. how much spacing should be there over. here. but when I remove padding. I'm not configuring anything inside but. with margin I'm configuring. something over here. when I remove margin from here you'll. notice. that this goes down all right let's save. it and you'll see the difference between. this text field. and the text size decreased because the. margin is removed when I put back margin. let's put all of them in one screen so. that you understand this further. and then when I save it. you can visibly see the difference over. here. so that's the difference between padding. and margin padding is related to the. stuff inside and margin is related to. the stuff outside I hope that was clear. now let's. maximize our code editor and this looks. good now also let's remove the color and. the entire container property so I'll. press Ctrl shift R remove this widget so. I remove the entire container and its. properties and we come over here this. looks good now the next thing we want to. do is add. a button but I hope before going into. the button you understood the difference. between padding and container padding is. just one widget and container is made up. of many many other widgets and that. includes the padding widget. but I always prefer using padding when. only padding is required you know I get. to know. what exactly is happening over here if I. use container I'll be curious to know. hey am I doing anything else in the. container but anyways it depends on your. preference there is no performance. difference and now the final thing of. our UI the button now how do we put a. button over here so in material design. buttons can be classified broadly into. two categories one is the buttons which. are raised and other one is where the. button appears like a text all right. so the race button is kind of like an. actual button. that you might see on any. website. appears like a text button is something. that looks like a text but is actually a. button so first let's take an example of. how text button looks and then we can go. on to the raised button. so to create a text button we have to. type text. button how convenient. and now it requires two arguments which. is on pressed and child when I click on. text button it automatically completes. this for me and asks me to put the. required arguments so for onpressed we. require something known as void function. and that can be nullable so basically we. need to pass in a function over here and. we can take the advantage of anonymous. functions that allow us to create a. function over here. so this function does not have a name of. its own. but. it is a function. kind of like a Lambda function in Python. if you've coded in it. then we have a child which requires a. widget now why do we require a child in. a text button that's because there will. be a button but what should the content. inside a button be. that's what child requires so we can. pass a text wire which says click me. all right now I'll just put commas so. that there's nice indentation. now I'll come over here. and you see click me is shown over here. and this acts like a button why because. when I long press over it. it gives me a splash effect that you can. see in the blue color. that's a button. now if I click on it nothing happens. that's because in this function we have. not done anything so in our function. over here we can pass. let's say a print call so we'll go ahead. and pass print here and says button. click we already know what a print. function is right and here I'm just. saying that whenever this button is. pressed I want the print statement to be. printed out in the console so I'll press. command J to open my debug console again. now I'll just restart my entire app. come over here click on this button. and you see button clicked if I click it. again. I see two written over here that means. button was clicked again now if I again. click there's three times button clicked. so this is what this function does. whenever you click on it. it runs the particular function. and it requires a type of only function. you cannot put some integer value over. here or some string value over here or. whatever you cannot do that because it. is of the type function like this and it. returns a void so you don't have to. return anything from here like this you. can just do this. or you can just leave it because that's. void now let's see why we get these two. errors this error we get because. we have to put a const before a text. this text button does not require a. constant. now you might ask why why does it not. require a constant when this is has a. Constructor of constant that's because. we have this function over here whenever. we have a function to be passed in. like this. it cannot be a constant button to prove. this if I just remove on pressed you see. we get. a warning here use const with the. Constructor to improve the performance. but then we also get an error saying the. named parameter on press is required. so this is the reason why we have to put. a const for the text if const for a text. button was allowed. then we wouldn't have to put a constant. for this text. I've explained this to you before and. let's go ahead put a constable now why. are we getting a warning over here and. one problem I have with warnings is that. I have to hover over them to understand. why the warning is there in the first. place. so. what can I do such that my warnings are. seen over here I don't have to hover. over a particular thing and see the. warning so for that we have a vs code. extension we can go to the extensions. tab type your. error. lens. then we have to choose this one. given by Alexander we can install. and now you'll see your errors and. warnings are seen in the same line. so this error lens makes sure that all. your warnings and errors are seen in the. file itself and you don't have to hover. over them I just prefer this way because. I get to know instantly what the warning. or error is. and it says don't invoke print in. production code try using a logging. framework and this error is there. because. of a certain thing known as lint which I. told you I'll cover later on now if you. again go to analysis option.yaml you see. include package flutter lens and that is. coming from the dev dependency flutter. lens surveyor. what flutter lens does is encourage good. coding practices you can see that in the. comment over here. now you can set your own coding. practices in the analysis option.yaml. file where you have the linter for. example if I an uncomment this line so. I'll press command slash to uncomment. the line then I'll click on command s. which saves the file and come over here. the warning for print is gone even if I. open the debug console in problems there. are no problems. because. here I've set a rule saying that avoid. printlint should be set to false. if I set it to True which is by default. and come away I get the warning again. and I'm not going to meddle with the. preset. lint which. tells us to not use print and production. code. and that's simply because if you print. stuff out you can also print. some confidential information and. because of that your users might be able. to see it if they have rooted devices or. they figure out a way to do so. so definitely we are not going to use. print like this there are two options to. use print now. either you can go ahead and use debug. print. the difference is debug print requires a. string only you cannot pass anything to. a print statement like we could in print. because it required an object. and we already know object is a super. class of all the data types we know. so now we can use debug print and that. removes the warning for us. or what you can do is. pass an if check over here and check if. we are in debug mode. only then do we want to. print this. now what is debug mode now there are. three types of mode in our applications. debug release and profile. right now. we are in the debug mode. basically just testing our application. building new features and all of that. release is how your app will look like. in production. and profile is a mixture of debug and. release and release you won't be able to. see. many error messages or later on we'll. see that when we add some other packages. they also print stuff out we won't be. able to see that in release mode we can. see that only in debug mode now what. profile does is run the app and release. mode. but give us our nice error messages. warning messages if there are any. and basically print is saying that hey. you can only use me in debug mode so now. that's why we are put debug print. now we are saying that hey if we are in. debug mode now how do we check if the. app is in debug mode or in release mode. to check that we have K debug mode given. to us by flutter. now if you see this is coming from the. package flutter Source Foundation. constants dot dot if we press command. and go inside you'll see K debug mode is. equal to not release mode and not. profile mode that means debug mode is. when. it's not a release mode or profile mode. so it's definitely a Boolean value and. if it's a Boolean value we can just pass. an if condition like this and print it. inside. now the error is gone because we are. printing in the debug mode in release. mode we won't be able to. see the Sprint message now you might be. asking hey that's fine now I understand. this but how do I run my app in release. on profile modes to do that you can. simply go to the terminal and run. flutter run dash dash release to run it. and release mode but release mode. doesn't work on iPhone simulator. you can run it on an iPhone actual. device. and same goes for profile mode you. cannot run profile mode on an iOS. simulator so what I'm going to do is at. the end Maybe. we'll try to run it on real devices and. see how it feels cool. so now that we are done let's get back. to our text button and let's improve the. design over here first of all I want. this text to say. convert instead of saying click me so to. change that I can just change the text. layer and have convert save it and when. I come back over here it's convert cool. next thing I want to do is. make sure the button background is black. so to do that I'll have to use one of. the text buttons properties. now let's take a look at the properties. text button gives us. it gives us on pressed which is a. required argument on that we already. filled that. then we have. on long press so what should happen when. you long press the button what should. happen when you hover over the button by. hovering it means when you just. have your cursor on the top of this. button this is especially used in. web applications because sometimes you. might want to change how your. button looks or how your. entire UI looks when you hover over a. button then there's on Focus change. what happens when you change the focus. then the style that's what we are. interested in right. even for the text we had textile. property. even for. the hint text or label or prefix. everything had its own style. so we can focus on style over here as. well so that's what we want. let's go ahead and put it over your. style which will be button style exactly. what it requires and we can create an. object of the button style class like. this. now we have two problems here first one. is the child argument should be last in. widget Constructor invocations that. basically means that whenever you create. a new widget child cannot be over here. it has to be the ending property. all the other properties should go above. child. and this does not have any performance. impacts but it's just readable code. because basically you're in a widget. tree right and if you have a text button. it's good to see the last thing over. here. it's just a matter of preferences if you. don't like this you can definitely go. ahead and Analysis option.aml and make. sure you add a lint. so that you avoid this kind of warning. you can do that and the next is we have. to use a constant before button style so. let's use it all right now if we do this. much nothing really changes because we. haven't provided any properties to. material button Style. now the first thing that I want to do is. change the background color of the. button so let's get access to the. background color. and it's not simple as it looks it. doesn't just ask for a color it asks for. material State Property with a generic. type of color which can be nullable and. material State Property is also nullable. and that that makes sense right. if we remove background color it works. if we want to put a background color. that also works so nullable makes sense. and then if you want to pass a color you. can pass if you don't want to pass a. color you can't pass it now how do I. make sure material State Property is. added over here to do that let's create. material state. property and create an instance but if I. do that it gives me an error because. it's an abstract class. so we cannot use material State Property. however we have something known as. material State Property all that we can. use. now if I come over here you see class. material State Property all it requires. the same generic type that our material. State Property requires. and it implements it. so that's why we can use it in. background color. now if you hover over this it is smart. to identify that it requires a property. or the value of a color why because your. background color required material State. Property color. and when we use material State Property. all it automatically. said hey use color so we have to pass in. a color over here now what is my. background color going to be well. colors.black let's try that save it come. over here and we have a button showing. up the next thing I want to do is change. the text style so. to do that I can maybe try to change the. textile property over here let's go. ahead and try to do that we have textile. then again we'll pass material State. Property all then we'll pass a textile. saying let's say color is colors Dot. white maybe that looks good. then we'll save it. come over here. and nothing really changes if I try to. restart the app still nothing changes. the reason for that is if you hover over. this property it says the style for a. buttons text widget descendants so we. are doing the correct thing. because buttons text widget descendant. is our text over here but the color of. the text style is typically not used. directly the foreground color is used. instead. so we need to use foreground color and. pass that in so we can have material. State Property all then we'll pass. colors dot White. let's remove the textile property and. let's see if that works. become aware and boom that works we have. a nice button displaying here and maybe. you're satisfied with this UI but I'm. not. because what I want to do is increase. the button's height and width and maybe. the font size of this text as well. so let's do that first we'll focus on. the sizing so to increase the sizing we. can do size. and it doesn't really have a size. property but it does have icon size. fixed size maximum size minimum size and. tap Target size. icon size is the size of the icon inside. of the button but we are not using any. icons so we can ignore that then we have. fixed size so what will the fixed size. of the button be irrespective of what. screen size we are on if we are on a. smaller device or we are on a bigger. device the size will remain the same so. let's go ahead with fixed size. and that requires again material State. Property all. and then we need to pass in something. known as a size. is size a class is size an enum what is. it well size is a class it already gives. us an auto suggestion if I tap over it. it gives me. two things to password width and height. to pass a width. maybe I can say 200 that should be. enough and height will be 50. now if I. save it come away my buttons. height and width both have increased but. I'm not satisfied with how much the. width increased I wanted to take the. entire space just like the text field. did. so maybe I can pass. the width as 300.. then maybe we can try 350.. still not enough so we can go ahead with. 400 and that's enough but that's not all. maybe we have to do 410. and that's enough. but what will happen if I use a smaller. or a bigger device. or if we just take a different device. altogether what will happen will the. thing be the same so let's go ahead and. try it I'm just going to call my pixel 6. emulator you can just call it like this. you know just click over here start the. pixel 6 emulator from here you don't. have to go to Android Studio to start it. now. after this device is selected I can. click on run run without debugging or. you can start debugging whatever you. want. I'll run without debugging press command. J go to the debug console. you see we have a bunch of Errors over. here but that's related to when. we put a textile property for this. button Style. and then you see we have reloaded which. is hot reload when we save it hot. Reloaded. but anyways I don't want to focus on. iPhone emulator now I'll just change the. device and focus from iPhone to pixel. and now I'll see all the. warnings. properties calls related to my Android. emulator okay and we see that it has. started if we come over here. there we go we have our app right here. but that's the problem when we are 400. on a different device size it looks. proper but on an Android emulator it. looks different and if you open web it. might look different. on a smaller device we might even get an. error why. because let's say I put 450 over here. because I want to cover the entire size. so this is what fixed size means no. matter what the device size is no matter. what the device screen is. this is going to be the size and it. works fine you know. it works well the problem here isn't. about the fixed size property or any. property that we are using it's about. the fixed value of the width that we. need to give is there no way such that I. can give maximum value to the width how. much ever it requires it can take. well there is a property to do so we. have double. you know this double. dot Infinity. so if we click command click on double. we'll go into the dot implementation of. double. and double is an abstract class as well. but we are not instantiating the double. Clause we are not doing double like this. instead we are calling the static. property of Infinity on it and infinity. is one one divided by 0. so it's. basically saying that take maximum. amount of space possible and if I save. on it right now and put commas. come over here. we get back our normal button. because that's the maximum amount of. speeds this button is taking in fixed. size property but what will happen if I. use minimum size minimum sizes that that. you need to take at least this much size. on whatever device you're on and if I. save it there we go on both the screens. our buttons are looking similar because. they are taking the maximum amount of. space possible. and what will happen if I do maximum. size and save it we'll get back to our. normal button. because what what it's saying is. the maximum size of this button should. be double dot infinity and 50. but if. you can have this value you should take. it. but in the. maximum screen device this is what the. button should have. but anyways we are going to go ahead. with minimum size because that's what we. want we want it to extend till the. entire end of the screen now you might. ask hey this doesn't look good I want. there to be this spacing. and we are going to tackle that the same. way we tackled our text field we are. going to wrap it with the padding widget. so we are going to come to the text. button press command shift r. then wrap it with a padding widget and. have Edge and such dot all 10.0 and. there we go on both the device screens. we have similar spacing perfect. now you might have a question why do I. have to wrap it with a padding widget. why can't I do something like double dot. Infinity minus let's say 40 because. here from the left hand right side you. have 10 10 so not 40 double dot Infinity. minus 20 and then save it the reason for. that is double dot Infinity isn't a. value. that you can. count it is infinity. it is an infinite value and you're. saying that minimum size should be this. double dot Infinity is saying that you. can take as much size as possible on the. screen. and then if you do double dot Infinity. minus 20. using Infinity minus 20 which is still. Infinity. so it doesn't have any effect over here. that's why you have to use the padding. also there is no other button style. property that will help you to remove. spacing from here. either you'll have to set. proper constraints but that will differ. on every screen size. or you'll have to. make a way like using a padding widget. using double dot infinity and all of. that stuff. so let's put a padding 10 again. and this looks good on all the screen. sizes perfect. now this is what text looks like. what will elevated look like then so. this is what the text button looks like. what will the raised button appear like. so to configure that we can just go. ahead and. instead of text button have. something known as elevated button and. you see we don't get any errors because. it requires the exact same things on. pressed as a required property child is. a required property and the same style. is required all the properties are same. on pressed on long press on Hover but. what changes is the design year. you might say hey there's no difference. I cannot see anything but there it is. this button right here is raised a. little bit what I'm going to do is put. this in a side by side view so that you. understand this better. let's come over here. let's get back to text button save it. and you'll see some sort of elevation is. gone. if I save it again. some kind of elevation is there. elevation is added by putting some sort. of background behind it there's some. kind of Shadow to it. to show this elevation I'm just going to. go ahead and Pass elevation 15. and elevation doesn't require double it. requires material State Property double. so let's go ahead and pass material. State Property all. 15 like this save it and you see there's. more Shadow behind so it appears more. elevated it gives a more you can say 3D. view it's not exactly 3D but it gives a. more. 3D kind of effect. that's what elevated button does and by. default it has its own elevation Setter. but text button does not have any. elevation set. so it's kind of like a simple flat. button and the fun fact is. elevated button was previously called as. raised button and text button was known. as flat button. because elevated button was erased and. flat and text button was flat. but then they decided to change it in. later versions of flutter so I hope you. understood the difference between these. two type of buttons now you can. obviously go ahead and configure more in. these buttons for example you can set. the shape let's go ahead and set one so. we have shape and that also requires. material State Property all. and then requires outlined border so. let's go ahead and pass outlined border. but there's nothing like. outlined border like this because it is. an abstract class so again we need to. find something that extends outline. border so for this we have multiple. types. let's go ahead with the one I know oval. border you see. as the name suggests it will be able to. create an oval border also if you press. command and go into the source code it. over border extends Circle border which. is another border you can also use. Circle Border in your code if you just. go here and use Circle border that will. be fine. but at the end of the day Circle border. also extends outlined border so oval. border extends outline border all right. now if I save it come over here this is. a button. looks kind of weird then we also have. the circle border you can try that. then. this kind of Border will look better on. a button that requires an icon in our. case we don't require an icon we just. require a text. but what I'm seeing is this might look. something like this you can have an icon. over here which will be icons dot let's. say convert that's nothing like that so. maybe. icons Dot money just to demonstrate you. see this looks good enough and when you. add elevated button on top of it this. will look much better. all right so this is what Circle border. can be used with oval border might be. there to create some. different UI style I don't know why. anyone would use oval border to be. honest in a production ready app that. needs serious. attention all right. then the other border that we have is. rectangle border. so we have. three types of rectangle border beveled. rectangle border rounded rectangle. border and contain as rectangle border. let's go ahead with the rounded. rectangular border save it come over. here and we have a button looking the. way we wanted it to now we can make some. advancements here because it requires. Border Side border radius everything. that we've seen before you can configure. over here. and all of that is named arguments. for example you can just go ahead and. mention border radius then you have. border radius Dot. circular. 10 also remove constant here because as. we know border radius dot circular isn't. a constant put constant for everything. so let's go ahead and put it. save it come over here and you see this. kind of design and this actually looks. good I'm happy with this. then we also have beveled rectangle. border it also has a border radius. property but we are just going to skip. that save it. the difference here is this is pointy. instead of having. arcs. in the edges over here. and the last one is continuous rectangle. border let's save it if you want you can. just go ahead using beveld rectangle. board not be weld sorry rounded. rectangle border and it will give you a. good enough design. now if you want to reduce the. border radius you can do that also let's. put some formatting in place. by putting some commas and this looks. good I'm satisfied so yeah this works. well also I'm just going to keep the. text button I'm not going to use. elevated button now let's remove all the. comments and yeah this looks good. now you might see that they're spacing. here between this button and this text. field already that's there because of. the padding property added here here we. have added a padding property saying. Edge and such dot all 10. so from all. the sides there is a padding of 10 from. the top from left from right and from. the bottom. that's why they're spacing over here. so we are done with the UI but still you. might be not convinced by what the style. requires right because every single time. we have to pass in material State. Property all then mention the color or. material state property or then mention. the size material State Property all. then mention the shape or the Border. now that is a lot of tasks to do so. instead of doing that we have an. alternative what we can do is. is do text button Dot and we have an. option of text button dot style from. by using text button dot style from we. don't have to mention material State. Property all for everything you directly. get options to color shape. minimum size fixed size maximum size all. of those things so you can just go ahead. and use text button.style from but since. I'm lazy to type it all again I'm going. to undo everything I did. copy this line right here press command. shift Z to redo everything so that I. come back to text button dot style from. and I'll just paste everything back. now I can remove all the material State. Property alls from here. and just put the required. colors and sizes all right. so that will work as well. but make sure you do it nicely otherwise. you might get confused with the brackets. and will. miss one of the brackets. also put a const here because size. requires that. and text button dot style from doesn't. give us constant thing because it is a. function functions cannot be constant. right. now if we save it like this. come over here. we have a text button showing as it is. as it was before no changes but instead. of having. material State Property all for. everything we have our simple colors and. sizes passed cool so I hope you're. convinced by this also if you have. elevated button you can go ahead and use. elevated button dot style from and it. won't stop you you'll be able to do all. the stuff great so we have a functioning. UI now this is all that was required for. our simple currency converter app. congratulations on being done with the. user interface we have learned quite a. lot even if you think it's a small. output. so you can leave the user interface at. this this looks decent enough. but if you want to add something there's. one element you can add which is an app. bar an app bar is the header thing that. we see right at the top you can add that. so let's go to our scaffold. it is not included in body right because. it's a header why will header stuff be. included inside of a body. header is included inside of a scaffold. there is an app bar so you can go ahead. and pass an ABBA an app bar requires. something known as a preferred size. widget but yeah you can go ahead and. Pass App barrier why because app bar. extends. or implements a preferred sized widget. and preferred size widget implements a. widget all right and if you see. preferred size widget. is an abstract class which just has one. getter inside of this. get preferred size. and app bar implements that. save it and you see our entire user. interface is looking quite different. that's because by default the app bar. has a color of blue. and that is something related to theming. which we'll get to when we build our. second application. but as of now we don't want this to be. blue or anything we just want it to take. the same color as this background color. so to do that we can change the. background color and set it equal to. colors.blue gray exactly what the. scaffolds background color is. but still we have this sort of elevation. here so we can remove this elevation by. setting the elevation property of the. app bar to zero and once we do that the. app bar is gone now you'll ask hey. what's the purpose of adding an ABBA if. you just wanted to erase it the reason. for that is at the top I just want to. mention. currency converter. so an app bar requires some sort of. title and here we have a title it. requires some sort of text right title. is a perfect choice for it. so we'll pass. title here and it the title requires a. widget so you can just pass in a text. widget and say. currency. converter also put a constable here save. it come back and we have currency. converter display. this is our app bar title in Android it. shows up on the left hand side in iOS it. is right in the center. so you can use either of them if you. strictly want to Center the title you. can go ahead and set the property of. Center title to true and if you do that. it is centered in both the places and if. you set to false it will be aligned in. the left hand side for both of these. devices also if you want to change the. color of this textile you can change it. by passing in a style textile what we. have already seen before color colors. dot black all right now if we come we. have currency converter displaying like. this but I don't like how it looks with. the style so I'm just going to keep it. like this good. Abba also has multiple other options. like if you want to increase the size. you can add a bottom preferred size. widget so that can be an app bar again. and you'll be able to have two app bars. then we have actions which requires a. list of widget now what is actions. actions is. a bunch of. buttons or a bunch of widgets that you. can show in the right hand side corner. over here. so we can have actions like this and. let's say you want to display a text. here saying hello. save it and you can show hello there now. this actions usually contains icons and. stuff so that you know if you want to. exit the app or do anything else you can. use that using actions actions is not. used for displaying text. now if you take an example of WhatsApp. WhatsApp has a. bunch of. actions so it has the video calling icon. the phone. call icon and the more options I can all. of those are. actions then we also have leading this. is also particularly icon or if you want. to display an image but it's generally. not for text. what leading does is shows some widget. over here and it only requires one. widget actions can have a list of. widgets just like a column but. they are displayed in a horizontal. Manner and leading only requires one. widget. now we'll get to all these properties. later on when we build our shopping app. but for now we don't need to get into it. and I'm also satisfied with the currency. converter app that we have till now now. let's figure out how can I make sure my. app functions right so when I've. mentioned the USD let's say 1.0 to 8. and click on convert I want to convert. to INR now how can I do that. this sounds very easy all we need to do. is first step is create a variable. that stores the converted. currency value. so right now we have the zero the. initial value of the variable is going. to be 0 then whenever we pass something. like 1.08 to it click on convert we'll. multiply 1.08 to the standard exchange. rate that we have let's say 81 because. one USD is 81 so we'll multiply 1.08. with 81 and whatever answer we'll get. we'll store in that variable. so we the second step is just going to. be to create a function that multiplies. the value given by. the text field. with 81 or whatever exchange rate you. have maybe you're not converting from. USD to INR you're converting to some. other value you can use that value not. 81.. then the third step is. to store the value. in the variable that we created. right so we created a function that. multiplies the value with 81 then we are. just touring the value in this variable. that we created and then. we only have to display that variable. sounds easy doesn't it. so let's try to do this in our stateless. widget so let's go ahead and do our. first step create a variable that stores. the converted currency value and also. what I'm going to do is copy all of this. and paste it outside of the class that. we have I'm not going to keep it inside. because it just obstructs my view and. will make it difficult for me. now what I'm going to do is go ahead and. create a variable inside of this class. so I can just go ahead and create a. variable and result is equal to 0.. but then we get an error saying this. class or a class that this class. inherits from is marked as immutable why. because we are extending a stateless. widget right and I told you in the. beginning of the. flutter section that the stateless. widget. is immutable. any Fields inside of it cannot change. and here we are allowing it to change. because it is not a constant or it is. not a final if we put Final End Result. over here the error will get resolved. but if we just put end result that means. this value can be reassigned this is a. mutable variable and it cannot be. present inside a stateless widget. so what can we do if we put final we. won't be able to change the value so it. doesn't make sense to make it final. however what we can do is put it inside. of the build function right if we put it. and result is equal to 0. it will work fine because this is a. function and function you can change the. value but inside a class a global. variable you cannot change. the value if it's immutable so end. result is equal to 0 is fine in this. function. now what I want to do is. take this value. from the text field. and multiply it by 81 whenever the user. clicks on convert. now how do I get the value from the text. field. if I come over here does text field have. any of the properties not really if you. use on submitted which is one of the. functions text field provides. you'll see we get a value. and if we try to print the value. I'm just printing it not debug printing. it because I'm going to remove this line. and open the debug console. come over here and let's say I type 1.2. convert. button click comes. on submitted is not triggered at all. because on submitted is triggered when. we click on return button from our. keyboard once I click on enter from the. keyboard we get 1.2 so this on submitted. gets triggered when the text field is. submitted and that's not the layout of. our app. if the user clicks on return that's fine. or even then we can do something but. when the user clicks on convert which is. another button that we've given them. then also it needs to get triggered. so we cannot use the on submitted. property. then what can we use such that whatever. value is present inside the text field. can come to this elevated button. meaning we want to get a value. provided by the text field or the user. input which is given to the text field. that is available throughout our entire. class because if elevated button can. access it any widget can access it right. so for that again we might have to. create something in the build function. or you can do that in the stateless. widget itself. what we need to create is. a text editing controller so we'll go. ahead and have text editing controller. and you're just going to name it text. editing controller which is equal to. text editing controller. now again we get the same errors that we. did before but this time there's going. to be a change we are going to call this. final text editing controller but as. soon as you put final aware you see. we still have an error can't define the. cons Constructor because the field text. editing Constructor is initialized with. the non-constant value. we get this error because text editing. controller if we click and go to the. source code. is not a constant Constructor. so we'll have to remove constant from. here. that means we'll have to remove constant. from the material app and as I've told. you multiple times before it will not. help in boosting the performance of our. app and I tell you why when we get into. another type of widget. in a few minutes. so again in this text editing controller. needs to be shifted at the top we can. put the constant back. and the constant is here as well great. now why is this text editing controller. constant because text editing. controller's value is not going to be. changed. we just have to take this value. and paste it inside of our text editing. text field you see we have a controller. property we can pass it over there so we. pass that. text editing controller paste it and. there we go. now through this text editing controller. will have access to. all the user inputs so if we come over. here in elevated button let's remove all. of this and we'll print text editing. controller if we just print that we'll. get something like instance of text. editing controller because text editing. controller is a class right however. let's try this. I'm also going to go ahead and restart. the app. I'll enter the amount so let's say 1.5. convert. and we get text editing controller and. yeah we are able to see all of the. properties inside of it. so we have text editing value with the. text. and the text is 1.5 which is correct. then the selection is there then text. Affinity is there. composing is there and all of that stuff. what we care about is text. so we are just going to access that so. we are going to have text rating. controller Dot and we see we have text. we can use that. so this will give us the text that we. require now we'll come here again. press 1.7 convert. Ctrl J and we have 1.7 so it correctly. gives us the right. answer in the elevated button that's. good now what I want to do is print. text editingcontroller Dot text into. 81 let's say that's the current exchange. rate from USD to INR. it's a rough value obviously but let's. go ahead with this let's restart our app. come over here we are going to type 2.5. convert. and here we see 2.5 to 0.52.52. so this is not what we want why is that. the case this is the case because text. editing controller.txt gives us a string. and we have already seen in the dot. course that. string into an integer will multiply. the string that many times so we have. 2.5 2.5 2.5 written out 81 times it's. not actually multiplying but it's just. concatenating adding the strings. together. so what we need to do is convert this. integer. or convert the string into an integer. and then multiply it with 81. so we can. have end dot parse and actually. we cannot have just in dot pass why. because n dot parse guarantees us that. we'll get only an integer but what if a. double is mentioned over here like 2.5. so we'll have to make this double dot. pass. and then wrap our text. editingcontroller.txt like this. so what double dot pass does is convert. the string into a double and integer dot. parse converts the string into an. integer okay. so let's try to do this press command J. come back over here let's type in 2.5. again click on convert and we have 202.5. which is correct 81 into 2.5 is 202.5. perfect. so that means you are getting a value. now we just need to store this value. inside of our result variable so let's. get rid of them. we are just going to go ahead and type. result is equal to. double dot pass. text editingcontroller Dot text. into. 81 but now if you see this we get an. error why because. a value of type double cannot be. assigned to a variable. the variable of type integer. and that's because the result is an. integer and this is converted to a. double and double into an integer will. give you a double. so you'll go ahead and change result to. a double correct. save it come over here and. we have successfully changed the result. now if we see this we should be seeing. 2.5 convert and this text isn't changing. why. and we are no longer getting the print. statement we are not getting the print. statement because we have removed the. print statement from on pressed but we. should be seeing the change in text. right not exactly because in text if we. go we still have a hard coded 0. mentioned over here. hard-coded 0 is not what we want we want. result to be mentioned over here so we. can go ahead and pass result. and now we get an error saying argument. type double cannot be assigned to. parameter type string because text. requires a string and result is a double. so what you can do is. result Dot tostring and that will. convert text to. a string right. so to summarize to convert from into. string. you have to do. the integer value. dot to string anything you want to. convert to a string you just call the. tostring method on it because that's. present on almost every object. and if you want to. convert from string to int or double you. do string value. and wrap it with n dot parse or double. dot pass all right. let's see with this but you're still. getting an error arguments of a constant. creation must be constant Expressions. the reason for that is this result. variable is changing right. this is a mutable variable it's. immutable aware and it's mutable because. of that. so it's saying that hey result is. mutable so this text cannot be a. constant. can it. so we'll have to remove this constant. we'll have to put constant textile. save it. and. we still have a warning over here you. can see it over here so let's go at the. top and see we have this warning which. says unused import. basically saying that this line you have. imported but it. isn't in use in your code. so we can just remove this save it let's. restart the entire app and Hope. that this works so we'll go ahead first. of all we can see the change 0.0 because. this is a result double value double to. a string will give you a string like 0.0. then we'll enter the amount in USD let's. say 4.5. convert. and nothing changes inside over here why. if we press command J. there's no error as well it should be. changing right. not exactly because right now what. you've done is created a result variable. you've. changed the result variable over here. but you've not. told this function to rebuild so the. result value has its own new. value all right there's no disagreeing. with that the result has a new value. but this function is not rebuilt again. if this function is not rebuilt again. we don't see the changes over here. just think about it we have a result. variable at the top then you change the. value so the value has changed now what. that's the end of the function that's. the end of everything now what should. the function do. exactly the function has nothing left to. do. and it doesn't automatically see the new. value compare the new value and display. it. so we need to make sure that we call. this build function again so how do we. call this do we go ahead and call build. like this. and hope that works so let's go ahead. and try it so we are going to have. please enter the amount in USD we are. going to have 2.5 click on convert and. still nothing changes it's just not. calling the build function again let's. go ahead and try it so in our build. function what I'm going to do is print. rebuild all right so right at the top of. this function whenever this function. gets called we're going to go ahead and. call the rebuild function. so that will let us know if this. function is being rebuilt so at first. this function is getting rebuilt right. because as soon as we extend the. stateless Widget the build function is. the first thing that is called. when you instantiate this now the first. thing the Constructor gets called First. and after that the build function is. called. and the build function is called. automatically that's why we get the. rebuilt first. but then when I put the value let's say. 2.5 click on convert the rebuild is now. 2 that means this is getting rebuilt so. why are we not seeing the output we are. not able to see the output because. this function runs again and as a result. double result is equal to 0 so it gets. re-initialized to zero the text editing. controller is now remade and everything. else is also rebuilt so the entire thing. is rebuilt as a result. the result is still zero we are not able. to see the changes. so what should we do to. get rid of this error maybe try creating. a global variable try creating it. outside of this class so I'll just have. double result is equal to 0 like this. and maybe that works so let's restart. the app and have 2.5 click on convert. and we are still not able to see the. answer. press command J there's no error. there's still two rebuilds. so this doesn't work. so let's get back to normal and. just don't ever try to create Global. variables unless it's really required. because Global variables are bad. I've already mentioned why in the dot. section. its value can be changed from any class. any function and if you have like 20 for. a small. application 20 classes you will be able. to change results from everywhere and. that's not a good thing because you. might get confused at some point and. change the value. anyways now what should we do to resolve. this. well the main reason for all of this is. stateless Widget the build function is. not meant for any initializations like. these. it's all fault of the stateless widget. and it's not exactly a forward of. stateless widget as well it's a fault of. us because we know stateless widgets. should not have any state and we are. still having states of air I did so much. so that I could explain you why. the stateless widget is immutable. and why you cannot change any of the. output on the screen. in a stateless widget so what is the. thing we should do to resolve this well. extend it to a stateful widget as simple. as that so I'm just going to create a. new class so that we see the difference. between a stateless and a stateful. widget so we have a class currency. converter material. page and I'm going to call this page G. all right now we have the error in. main.dot file but we don't care about it. as of now. I've just renamed this class to PG. so that I can create a stateful widget. with the name currency converter. material page now I'm just going to go. ahead and extend a stateful widget. now as soon as I do this I again get. errors because it requires methods what. is the method is it the build function. no it just requires one thing stateful. widget dot create state. so we need to implement. a create State function. if we go in stateful widget. and scroll down we have state create. state that is what we want to do so we. are going to have state create State and. then we want to return a state now what. is the state can we just return a state. like this no because state is an. abstract class and in this abstract. class we have the widget property we. have our build context we have. something known as mounted but if we. scroll way down you will also see. a very familiar thing here. and that is the build function. so that means we have to go ahead and. create our own class that will extend. the state class. because then we'll have a format that is. similar to this thing right over here. because we'll have access to build. function. so now we are going to go ahead and. create a class and I'm going to call. this currency. converter. material page State and that is going to. extend state. and see here how what I have done I've. marked this as private class why because. I don't want this class to be accessible. outside of this file. only this class should be accessible. outside this class should not be and now. I can copy this paste it inside and our. errors go away because I'm returning a. straight right if we extend State class. and return this currency converter. material state. we are returning a state I hope that. makes sense we still have warnings but. we'll resolve them later on. now what it requires is a concrete. implementation of state DOT bill and. it's the exact same thing as this thing. so you can have. either it override widget dot build and. then we can return let's say a constant. scaffold. so we have basically two classes over. here. first one is currency converter material. page that extends a stateful widget. and as a result we have to create the. create State method and here it requires. a state but we cannot create an instance. of the state class because. it is an abstract loss. and the abstract class is basically. saying that hey. just extend this get the build function. and then write your entire apps code. over here. now you might ask what is the purpose of. these two separate classes. the reason for that is here we create a. state and what state does is very. interesting the state will allow us to. create our variables will allow us to. create our functions and also. everything inside of this class can be. IM can be mutable so I can go ahead and. type double result is equal to 0 and. that doesn't give me a warning or an. error. it's all good inside of this. but here if I try to go ahead and create. double result is equal to zero we have. an error this class is marked as. immutable. because stateful widget. has a constant Constructor but state. doesn't have that it's an abstract class. that allows. so we just need to extend State and that. does a work. now we have understood the structure of. a stateless widget and I hope you are. understanding what I'm doing. again if you want a brief and you have. some questions let's go along the code. we have a class that extends a stateful. widget then we have create State. function that creates the state. but then. we cannot. instantiate State class aware so what we. need to do is create our own state that. extends the state class and as a result. we can put that over here inheritance. concept. then we need to override the build. function and here it's the exact same. thing as this thing you can create your. own stuff. the reason there are two different. classes is because you cannot create. mutable variables inside of this class. so that you know we still have a. Constructor that is constant but you can. go ahead and create your own mutable. variables here because this does not. have a constant Constructor. and this is a private thing because it. should be accessible only for this. class so that we could create a state it. should not be accessible outside of this. file. leave outside of this file it should not. be accessible outside of this class also. but. that's how private variables work in dot. we've talked about this in the dot. course. so we'll have to live with this. now let's resolve the warnings the first. warning that we have is Constructors for. public widgets should have a key. parameter so just like this we have to. create. a constant Constructor so we have. currency converter material page super. dot key inside of a named argument save. it then we have creates date and it says. the member create States override an. inherited member but isn't annotated. with override so basically since this is. there because of stateful widget we have. to put add the rate override. just like we did with the build function. right and there we go we have created it. now there are still some things you can. do if you want to improve for example. State takes a generic type of a t that. extends stateful widget so you can have. a generic type over here and it should. be a stateful widget so you can go ahead. and pass currency converter material. page. but then we get an error over here. saying the currency converter material. page. can't be returned from the method create. State because it has a return type of. State currency converter material page. but you'll say hey that's the same thing. happening over here right not really. because here extend State we also have. to put the generic type again which is. currency converter material page as soon. as we do that we get the errors resolved. basically since you have not typed. anything over here in the T. it wasn't able to identify that these. two things are of the same. class and their stateful widget is the. same currency converter material page. but it's still an improvement and if you. don't put it it's fine. and if you put it it's better. awesome. so now what I'm going to do is show you. the difference between the stateless and. the stateful widget in stateless widget. we just add a Constructor and then we. add the override here we have a. Constructor we have create state that. creates our class over here. then we have our override build function. and then a scaffold. now the state. just doesn't do this it gives us access. to multiple more methods if you press. command and go inside of it we get. access to a getter called widget we also. have access to build context. so yeah you can use context over here. it's accessible. here the build context was accessible. only inside the build function but their. context is accessible even inside of. this state. then we have access to mounted which we. look at in a while. NH state. this is one important method that we'll. go into take a look at later on then we. have did update widget another important. thing reassemble. then set State a very very important. thing that we are going to take a look. at in this. app itself then. we have deactivate and we have activate. and then we have dispose another very. important thing. so it has access to methods like this. which will give us more capabilities. inside of our stateful widget with. stateful Widget with stateless widget. sorry you don't have access to any of. those things. okay anyways. now what I want to show you is. what all things get called over here so. I'm just going to remove this. we have our currency converter material. page only or actually press command Z. let's copy the entire build function so. that we don't have to rewrite all the. design that we created let's put it over. here. let's get rid of the class now okay so. build function has this thing we don't. have to type it again. now we have rebuilt over here. okay inside of the build function I'm. just going to call this build function. then I'm going to call. create state I'm going to convert this. to a block this is not an arrow function. anymore it's a block and we are going to. return. currency converter material page State. from here but I'm also going to print. create state. then we are going to have our. Constructor and I'm going to have. print. Constructor. and then it says constant Constructors. cannot have a body so let's remove. constant for now only for now we'll put. it back but I just want to show what all. things get called okay. now we'll press command J we'll restart. our entire app then we have Constructor. the first thing that gets called is this. thing then create state which is this. thing and then we have build function. but what if you have certain tasks that. need to be done before the build. function but are accessible only inside. of this class. I mean let's say you've created a. variable double result. but you're not getting the value over. here it's a late value maybe you call an. asynchronous function and. you're getting the value after let's say. two seconds. how do you make sure that you get it. before the build function is called. because you need to display it right you. need to display it over here so for that. reason we have a method given by our. state class which is init state. all right. so as soon as we type in it it. autocompletes it for us but if you want. to know the syntax it's just at the rate. override because it's coming from the. state that we are extending then we. avoid init state. a function. then we can remove two to implement in. its state. then we call super.net state which calls. the init state of the parent class and. we've already seen this this thing is. our state class all right let's go at. the top to see. this thing right here this is the state. class. so it calls the energy State of the. State class and does whatever it needs. to do for example the state life cycle. created. now what is the state life cycle what. I'm showing you right now is widget. State life cycle of a stateful widget. that means what all stuff gets called. what all stuff. executes when. so when does. in its state get executed. we'll just put print rebuilt over here. save it. and come over here let's restart the app. and we have Constructor create State. rebuilt. build function. so Constructor is called create state. but now instead of build function we. have the rebuilt being called init state. so NH state is what gets executed. right before the build function. so if you want to assign any values that. are coming from let's say some futures. or streams you can do it in any state. but for simple initializations like ours. double result is equal to zero. you can put it over here like this. so let's get rid of them. and let's convert everything back to. normal. so let's have something like this done. we have an arrow function. we have a Constructor and this is a. constant even in the main function then. or a main file we have to put const. three. so we have got double result over here. let's remove that save it restart come. over here. and let's put text editing controller. outside of this build function why. because build function should always be. as less expensive as it can be why. should the build function be. less expensive because build function. can potentially be called in every frame. because of a function that we call all. right. there's a function that will trigger the. rebuild of this build function so this. function can potentially be called in. every frames so if you have a phone that. has a refresh rate of 120 hertz. your build function can be called 120. times in one second. and if it is called that many times. that means your build function needs to. be less expensive it cannot have any. asynchronous tasks first of all. of that needs to be done in the currency. converter material page state. not in the build function because. asynchronous task can take like one two. seconds and in one second you have to. call 120 times if it is done. so if it is called 120 times per second. you have like 8 milliseconds to run all. of the build functions or or the stuff. inside of this build. function because one second is thousand. millisecond and it can be called 120. times so 1000 divided by 120 which is 8. milliseconds. so it's always good to keep this method. as efficient as possible so you don't. have to put any asynchronous tasks. you don't have to do. anything that will be expensive this. thing over here is not expensive you're. just assigning a variable which does. hardly anything. you can also push this right at the top. but since it is UI related I like to. keep it inside of the build function. only. and if you don't. return a result in the given time frame. it can result in frame drops so it can. cause UI stuttering and will cause lags. in your UI which is not a good thing. for the user experience so always keep. this build function as simple as. possible and here it's quite simple. anyways we have our result now and we. have changed the value but still. let's remove build context from here the. thing is the same. we have our variable created here. then we have. result is equal to double dot parse into. 81. and we are not triggering the build. function rebuild. so what should we do then. well we can go ahead and call the build. function like we did and let's see what. it does let's restart Also let's print. rebuilt aware that looks kind of. interesting. come over here and we have 2.5 convert. nothing happens. because in the build function you don't. have to call. re uh build function again. right this is not the good way of doing. it. what you can do instead is call a. function that is provided by state and. we've looked at it before in the state. class as source code which was such. State I told you that this is a very. important function right so what you. need to do is search date and it. requires you to put in a function void. function function so you have this. Anonymous function here and then you can. pass this thing right yeah. now if you restart. and I don't know why but I removed. rebuilt print statement so let's put. rebuild again. press command J restart the app and now. if I put 2.5 click on convert yes we see. the output 202.5. and it was rebuilt. why that's what such does. what set state does is set the state if. you dive into the source code you won't. be able to understand anything but here. at the end there's one thing element dot. marks need Mark needs build. basically saying that it's telling. the widget tree not widget tree. something known as Elementary but we'll. get to it after the second app. but it's just telling that hey this. widget needs a rebuild but that doesn't. mean it will start rebuilding this. entire class again no. it will only build this build function. only this function gets called again and. necessary widgets are rebuilt. now. the set States function doesn't do. anything okay if you want you can just. put it here like this and it will work. the same way all right so if you have. 2.5 it will still work the same way this. function is given to you so that it is a. convenience for you to put everything. that needs a rebuild inside of here. however what set state does is just tell. the widget tree or the elementary will. get to it. that this particular thing needs a. rebuild so build the build function. again and only build the necessary. widgets you see it notifies the. framework that the internal state of. this object has changed the internal. state of our object is the result. variable that we created. and whenever you change the internal. state of a state object. we did change the internal State of the. State object via our state and this was. our object we change the value so we. call such state. also this function that we have cannot. return a future it cannot be. asynchronous. and then you can read all of this thing. if you want to and gain extra knowledge. but as of now what's important is that. this calls build function only that's. what it does triggers a rebuild. using the build function. perfect so we've converted our currency. from USD to INR. now if I change it to 80 and restart my. entire app let's say I put 2.5 this. gives me 200 great if I put 2 click on. convert 160 if I put 150 convert I get. 12 000.. and if you want to do something extra. what you can do is put INR over here but. we have to encapsulate everything in a. string. so we'll just have dollar result. dot two string. but I've already mentioned it to you if. you have result.2 string inside of. string interpolation we can skip. result.2 string and we can just have INR. dollar result. and now we have INR 12000 if you want to. put a Rupee symbol or your currency that. you've converted you can put that. so that marks the end of our currency. converter material app. now let's take a look at what Cupertino. app looks like I hope you are familiar. with all the code that we have written. till now we have gone through a lot. we've gone through stateless widget. stateful widget the state set State NH. State we are going to dive into sets in. its state and all of that set state is. almost required everywhere. so we'll keep using that and we'll keep. brushing our concept I hope you also. understood the purpose of text editing. controller text editing controller gives. us access to text in the entire widget. wherever we want. and last thing that I'd like to mention. is the on press function over here. since this is a function that requires a. type of void function like this you can. go ahead and create. a function over here so let's copy it. and have void convert. and paste this over here also remove the. brackets this thing right here convert. now you can go down. and pass it to on pressed so you can. either do it this way convert like this. or. you can just pass convert like this. don't call it like this you have to call. it like this why because convert has a. function type of void function just like. this requires so it's a tear off. function. since both of them match in what they. require void function and this is also. the same thing. you can just pass it like this however. when you call it this. it means you're calling the function and. you don't have to call the function in. on press because when you call it you. return a type of void. and void cannot be assigned to on. pressed. so that's why you just have to put. convert over here and that will work as. well such state is accessible throughout. our currency converter material page. State and widgets are always immutable. the state makes this class mutable so. there is no performance. impact on our widget. this is still a constant but this isn't. so we have mutable stuff over here and. that is why we have two classes many. people don't understand this but I hope. you've understood this also let's remove. color from here and we have our app. ready so we have a currency converter. material page ready there's still a lot. of stuff you can do there is a lot of. edge cases that you can handle for. example. a UI change. just take a look at this you have a. padding over here which has agencies.all. 10 then you have a padding over here. which has agencies.all 10 so what you. can do instead is just wrap this entire. column with a padding widget instead of. wrapping all of the widgets separately. in a padding widget. so what you can do is. select this copy press Ctrl shift. r. to open the refactoring option remove. this Widget the same goes over here Ctrl. shift R remove the switcher then you can. wrap the entire column. by doing comma Ctrl shift R wrapping it. with. a padding widget and pasting our. agencies.all 10 over here. and once we do that. we have spacing left from here but all. the spacing beneath it is gone so we. need to add that. so do you mean I have to put text field. again in a padding widget no then what. is the sense of making padding widget. over here no what you can do is use a. container right by container you can. mention a height let's say you want to. leave a height of 10. then the same. thing you can save it and you have your. height left out. but here's the problem this container. doesn't have a constant. Constructor. and as a result. when I have to rebuild this container. will also get rebuilt unnecessarily. that's what constant does. whenever your function is going to get. rebuilt your widgets will also get. rebuilt what constant sees it. is this doesn't need a rebuild because. this is a constant if you have a. constant it will not read need a rebuild. but container doesn't have that. and it will be unnecessarily rebuilt. because. we just have to leave a space we just. need to leave a height why can't it be a. constant then that's why we have access. to constant sized box size box helps us. leave a space you know container is a. all-in-one widget it will help you to. add height width padding margin color. but what size work does is just help you. leave width height. and it has a constant Constructor so. instead of using container everywhere. you can use a size box it doesn't have. any difference in the UI but it does. have a difference in performance now. it's a very very small impact. but it still has an impact. so let's try to make our apps as. efficient as possible so with this we. don't have to wrap any other widgets. that we'll add inside of the widget tree. with a padding widget all of them will. have their automatic padding and now. even text has a padding. so if it exceeds this length it still. has a padding so that's great and one. last Edge case that I can see is if I. put 2.52 click on convert I have this. but if I put multiple digits we have our. INR extending till below I don't want. that maximum I want is let's say. one or two digit I don't want it this. precise so what I can do is. wrap this and have dot two string and. you have multiple methods for it two. string two string as exponential two. string as fixed and two string as. precision. I'll use two string as precision and. pass 2 over here. and when I do that I get INR 2.0 e plus. 2. now this is not in the format I want. if you use calculator you know what this. is talking about if you haven't don't. care about it I don't want it like this. what I want is to string as fixed Maybe. then we can add 2 over here and we have. INR 201.77. so it only gives me a maximum of two. digits and if you want you can give. three widget and it will work fine then. restart and you add INR 0.0.00. now if you want to avoid this whenever. you have 0 you don't want it to extend. till 3 does it. after the decimal place what you can do. is. add a ternary operator over here inside. of this. string interpolation itself what you can. do is if result. is not equal to zero so if result is not. equal to 0 then we want this thing right. since our result was not 0 I wanted. 204.480 but since my result is not 0. anymore. I'll want. result dot 2 string. as exponential. zero. so I don't want there to be any. exponents now if I restart. I get e again but that's not I want. sorry I want to string as fixed. and then we can save it we come over. here we get inr0 but if I put 2.566 like. this I get three digits maximum so we. have handled the edge case over you are. using the ternary operator now you know. how everything is coming back to its. places we learned everything separately. in the dart course and now everything is. coming together you can't use an if. condition over here. because you know it doesn't make sense. how can you use it inside of a string. interpolation. so you can go ahead and use. ternary operator. great so this is our app for the. material page I'm going to get done with. this now now what we are going to do is. go ahead in the lip folder and create. currency converter Cupertino. page dot dot now you're going to have a. Cupertino design so let's go ahead and. design it so the first thing to do here. is to import material.dot right not. really because when we import. material.dot we get all the widgets. related to material design. like this elevated button but we don't. want that so I'm going to go ahead and. import. cupertino.dot which is similar to what. we saw earlier. all right. now cupertino. will give us only the. things that. are following Cupertino design now we. have to go ahead and create our state. full widget now do I have to type the. entire stateful widget here that can be. cumbersome right. just writing all of these classes. I made you type earlier so that you. understood what was happening here but. now that we have understood it we can. type here SPF L and you see we have. something known as a code snippet. when we click on this we get all the. boilerplate code required to create a. stateful widget. this is provided by the flutter and Dot. vs code extension that we added so now. we have access to the currency. so now we have access to the state full. widget snippet we also have access to. stateless widget snippet I'll show you. after we type the name of this class now. I don't want my class name to be my. widget right so it already highlights. everything for me and all I have to do. is type the name so we have currency. I made a typo we can type currency. converter Cupertino page all right and. it changes it everywhere there is so. wherever it's necessary it will change. it now I can save it and there we go now. it is returning a please holder for us. we don't want that what we want is. all the things that are returned over. here and then we can go ahead and change. whatever is not required so let's go. ahead copy this. return the build function because at the. end of the day we need to have the same. kind of layout. but now we have many errors we'll solve. them but before that let's go ahead and. copy the logic as well all the text. editing controller result and all of. that. now we can come over here save it and. there we go the errors reduce but in no. way are they lesser why because we have. introduced cupertino.dot and outline. input border scaffold ABBA all of them. follow the material design. you see stuff like Center padding column. text are not affected by Cupertino or. material design they are present in both. of them Cupertino and material because. the. typography is not decided by the text. itself it is decided by what we are. returning away a material app or. Cupertino app. and then we have column which is a. layout thing padding which is basically. just leaving space so it doesn't have to. follow material or Cupertino design. guidelines and Center is again. a design guideline. and Center is again. a layout widget. so now we have to go ahead and change. everything. first of all I'm going to go to the. main.dot file I'm going to create a. stateless widget here so to create a. stateless widget you can type St L and. then you have a snippet for stateless. widget as well. you click on this and then it creates. all the boilerplate code for a stateless. widget now you can just type my. Cupertino app. okay then you are going to return this. exact thing but instead of material app. you're going to have Cupertino app. and this also accepts a home argument. though these two things are different. kubatino app doesn't have the same theme. that it requires it requires Cupertino. theme data and this requires. just a theme data. okay so there are differences but. anyways now let's take this. put it over here we all have my. Cupertino App instead of my app so it. will run this class not this class. so this class is basically never. executed. now we can save this. also we can have currency converter. Cupertino page instead of currency. converter material page otherwise it. might give you some weird output. now let's come back over here now we are. returning a scaffold scaffold is. apparently a part of material or not so. what we need to do here is return. Cupertino scaffold. scaffold. allows you to create. a an app bar at the top so we definitely. want Cupertino page scaffold. then it has multiple things it doesn't. have the Abba property or the body. property let's see what it requires it. wants a child property so our child is. going to be this thing which is nice. and then we have navigation bar so we. can return a navigation barrier. and in navigation bar it requires. obstructing preferred size widget it. doesn't require preferred size widget. anymore which is what app bar is. and also app bar is from material.dot so. maybe we can go ahead and type Cupertino. Abba and maybe we get something but no. but if we type Cupertino. navigation bar. we get that and Cupertino navigation bar. is exactly what we can pass over here. now gopertino navigation bar is the same. thing as app bar at the top. so we don't need to worry about it. then it has a bunch of properties what. we require is a title and if we come. over here. we see a widget which is middle and as. you already know in iOS Style. the title is always always Center if it. is already centered. it makes more sense to name it middle so. what do you want in the middle. so we can have middle over here sweet. and if you see there's no thing as. elevation over here because Cupertino. widgets don't really have any elevations. or depth to them. so we can remove this. now to resolve the colors error if we. press command full stop to get a list of. fixes we can apply to a project we see. import Library package flutter. material.dot because. material.dot also includes the colors. your app is going to have. so we cannot use the colors class but we. can go ahead and use Cupertino colors. and it gives me a bunch of colors now. I'm going to go ahead and have Cupertino. colors Dot. blue then we have two type of colors. system blue or Active blue. I don't want any of those maybe Gray. let's go ahead with system gate grade 3. then we can save this much then we can. again copy this and the exact same thing. let's hope we like the version that it. spits out. Also let's put a const over here because. Cupertino colors. are constant all right. why because if we come over here it is. abstract final class right. so let's exit this. now let's scroll down we have text field. so instead of text field here what we. require is Cupertino. text field there we go. as easy as it gets. whatever is there in material.just put. Cupertino before it and it will become a. Cupertino widget. it has the same property of controller. but color again we'll have to put. Cupertino colors dot black so that's. fine. I'll copy this line again and paste it. over here. but here the decoration requires box. decoration. and box decoration is. not related to input declaration so we. have to get rid of input decoration and. just pass in box decoration over here. now let's design everything that we have. the first thing we need to mention is. the border so let's go ahead and pass in. a border now the Border it requires is. box border so maybe we can type in box. border but that isn't allowed. however if we just type border dot all. it allows us to pass it in so we can. just have border.all. then we need to mention the color of our. border and the color of our border is. the default one so we're just going to. leave it at that then we also have to. mention the Border radius the Border. radius is 5 so let's go ahead with that. let's take the default one then we have. border radius. and the Border radius is going to be. border radius dot circular five that's. good. now we can try to mention the color as. well. so the color of the text field we want. is. colors.white so we can go ahead and pass. Cupertino colors dot y I guess that will. work right. and that's all that we require so maybe. we can just get rid of all of this. we still need to mention hint text so. let's copy it and then get rid of this. and see the decoration doesn't give us. properties to change the hint text. however Cupertino text field does give. those properties and there we have it. placeholder we also have the prefix. widget and it doesn't have all of those. prefix stuff. like prefix icon prefix prefix style it. just has prefix which requires a widget. that is cool. so if we go ahead and type hint over. here there's no hint related stuff. but. if we type placeholder and then type. please enter the amount in USD that. should work. and then finally we need a prefix widget. which is I can ikins dot monitor not I. can we cannot use icon why where are the. icons. is also coming from material.dot we. cannot use that. so we can go ahead and type something. like Cupertino icons and there we have. it so we can pass in Cupertino icons Dot. money. and it does have money dollar sign. exactly what I need. and put a const over here perfect. so this looks good now the final thing. that I need to work on is button. elevated button is also coming from. Material design now you might have. noticed that everything that was UI. related changed from material to. Cupertino dot dot. and all the layout widgets like column. padding Center and text because that. depends on cupertino.settings or. Cupertino app settings. that's fine. so let's go ahead and instead of. elevated button we are going to use. Cupertino button as simple as it gets. then Cupertino button requires a child. which we have already passed then it. requires a color. so what is the color you want so the. color I want is. black so we are going to have Cupertino. colors dot black. then I want something sizing related so. we have minimum size. maybe we can look into that so we have. minimum size and that is a double. the default is K minimum interaction. Dimension Cupertino let's go over that. whenever you have. something like K it is meant to be a. constant. that's flutter's way of saying that hey. this is a constant now we can dive into. this and we have 44 showing here and. then it has design guidelines about it. so I'm not going to meddle with it I'm. just going to keep it as it is and see. what the output is if I want to change. it I can go ahead and change it right. and then maybe I can remove all of this. the only thing that's left is to make. sure the color is white and. the shape is rounded rectangle border. with a border radius of 5. so let's get. rid of it. and almost all our errors are done let's. also remove this because border is not. being used in text field anymore. so let's get rid of this save it. restart our entire app Ctrl J. or command J no problem we come away and. our entire apps design is now changed. this is how it looks in Cupertino design. and I'm quite satisfied with how the. button is looking over here so I'm not. going to meddle with the size however. you can go ahead and change it also if I. pass 200 click on convert it's still. working if I press 12 it's still working. great. so this is how the app looks in. Cupertino design this is how the app is. going to look like in material design. you can design for yourself which one. you want I like this one better because. it gave me more customizability. and I just like the design and feel of. it. I don't like how the text Fields look in. Cupertino design the main difference is. that material design follows a more. Dynamic and Visually Rich approach it. uses Shadows depth effects bold colors. and it often incorporates elements that. mimic Real World objects and materials. that's why material design. now Cupertino design has a more. minimalistic and flat aesthetic and. focuses on Simplicity subtle gradients. and. although I do like minimalistic design. Cupertino design is just not my taste. so from now. on I'm going to go ahead and. design only material designed. applications if you want you got a taste. of how Cupertino Works basically any. widget you have. just put a Cupertino before it and. you'll get a widget similar to that and. if you don't you always have Google. where you can ask your question. about the equivalent of. let's say a particular widget in. material design. in Cupertino design okay. so we are done there's one last thing. that I want to mention and that this. goes for both of these. classes currency converter material page. and currency converter Cupertino page. and that's the use of text editing. controller whenever you. any form of controllers later on we'll. see that there are a bunch of. controllers. like there's animation controller or. page controller draw controller scroll. controller stream controller which we've. already seen. all of those need to be canceled or. disposed of. so that they don't have any data leaks. or memory leaks in your application. so for that reason. the state also gives us a nice property. or a nice function which is the dispose. function. in dispose function. it is usually recommended to put. super.dispose at the last and in its. state you might remember that super.net. state should be the first thing and. after that you will have rest of the. other things because then you want to. call the parent class and initialize. everything but in this pose you just. removing certain objects from your. widget tree. and this dispose is called whenever your. widget is no longer existing maybe you. move from one page to another by. replacing the current page this is when. the dispose. function will get called so in that case. you don't want to instantly delete or. dispose of whatever is present in the. state class first you want to dispose of. your own. classes. your own controllers and streams or. Futures whatever you want to dispose. and then you'll call Super dot dispose. to dispose of everything that's present. in the. State class all right so here what I'm. going to do is pass in my text editing. controller and call dispose method on it. so this will dispose of the text editing. controller it will. basically discard the entire text. editing controller and say that hey this. object is basically not existing anymore. and that avoids memory leaks all right. so you can consider dispose to be. kind of like the exact opposite of NH. state in its state gets called. before the build function before. anything builds and this pose gets. called right after the entire widget. is going to get discarded. cool so let's get rid of this and now we. are done with our entire. currency converter app congratulations. on building your first ever flutter app. which is working quite well. to understand about widget life cycle we. must first know what widgets are and. what a life cycle is everything in. flutter is a widget so before knowing. about lifecycle we must first know what. the widgets are and if you are seeing. this video there's a great possibility. that you have already created widgets in. your app to Define it in the least words. possible widget can be considered as. every class you make and can call in the. build function without any errors and if. you don't know what build function is it. is a function that is used to render. something on the screen every flutter. app is a combination of two type of. widgets stateless widgets and stateful. widgets stateless widgets are those type. of widgets where the state once created. cannot be changed that is it can run. only once which is when the app is. loaded this also means that this type of. widget cannot be redone after any user. interactions. this is an example of stateless widget a. stateful widgets on the other hand are. widgets where the state can be changed. and we can make this build function over. here run multiple times with different. widgets to render or different string in. a text any value can be changed now. let's understand the life cycle of these. widgets so we are back to our stateless. widget and as you can see that the my. stateless widget which is a class name. of a stateless widget has overridden the. build function here which can written. return only one widget at the end which. here we are returning a scaffold so. whenever my stateless widget is. instantiated it will call the build. function and draw that one widget on the. screen. so if we have to understand it in a. chart flowchart format. first we call the Constructor. and then after which the build function. will get executed pretty simple right. now what about State full widgets we. have a Constructor here. after which the build function will be. called right no you see in this code. demo my stateful widget is a stateful. widget and we have a build function here. but before that you can see create State. over here. as the name suggests this creates the. state of our app it also returns an. instance of the associated state. now that we have access to the state in. our app flutter provides us with some. methods to use as and when we want first. is in its state and this is how you can. create in its state function. what is in its state right in its state. is the method which runs once after the. Constructor of our app and created state. is called. since it basically runs in the very. beginning of the app we can initialize. data and properties with some value we. can also subscribe to streams and make. connections with sockets let me show you. a demo suppose I have a variable of data. type end and I'll call it ABC and I have. to instantiate it with a value I can. just do it like this. or I can just. mark this as late. go over here and put ABC equal to 10.. now I'll go in the text and over here. I'm going to return abc.2 string since. text accepts a string format. and I'm not going to return it as a. constant because the value can change. now if I go over here and let me return. my state full widget over here you can. see that we are getting 10 as our. outputted value and that is exactly what. we wanted. now I'll also take a moment to explain. the General Internal working of NH state. if we scroll up and we see that our. class inherits from state which is an. abstract class. as you can see over here we also have. override over here which means we are. telling flutter that we are putting in. its state over here and it isn't a. mistake we are deliberately trying to. add our own energy State function and. not use the image State function present. in the state abstract class super over. here creates a reference to the parent. object in state class. and then calls the NH State function. there as well now where should I place. the code I want to execute in the NH. State function right over here on the. top or over or below it well flutter. documentation says that the code should. be placed after calling super in its. state. exactly like I've done for the variable. ABC. but after further inspection in the. state class I'll go to the NF State. function in the state class over here. I found out that the initi state. function basically does nothing that. affects our app so I don't think it. matters. wherever we place the code this same. internal working is followed in every. function that we're going to have a look. at uh in the following tutorial the. second function that we have over here. is did change dependencies this method. is called immediately after energy State. method moreover this budget will be. called again after the piece of the data. the widget depends on is updated this. function is used very rarely as a build. method is called after this next we have. a function called did update widget this. function runs whenever the widget. attached to the state is replaced by. another's widget here you can see that. we are also getting our old widget which. is replaced and if you want to get the. data of the new widget. you can just do print and use the widget. that we always have. this function is used rarely as well. last method we have to discuss is. dispose. this function is used to remove all the. connections our app has this is a very. important function most of the people. forget to use and I admit even I have. forgotten many a times dispose is a. place where we can subscribe from all. the connections or listeners thus it. helps us in removing some things from. the app's memory and prevents our app. from memory leaks let me prove what I'm. saying with the help of the code now. I'll write print everywhere in our app. and all the functions that we have. I'll write here from init state. I'm just going to copy this print. command and paste it in all our. functions. from disperse. from did update. sorry from dead update widget. from. did change. dependencies. and even over here in the create state. I'm just going to replace this Arrow. function. I'm just going to copy this I'm going to. return this we have the my stateful. widget state. and over here I'm going to print. from create state. over here as well I'm going to replace. I'm going to print. and we are going to type from. Constructor. right. now we can just ignore the warnings the. warnings that we have. I'll refresh our app. and let me just remove the int ABC parts. from here as well and I'm going to. introduce a part of the code uh where we. can see something interesting happening. not just a piece of text that's showing. up. I'm going to replace this. with this cool now let me run my app and. now you can see that if we click over. here we get a model bottom sheet with. which three uh with three options. and if we go over here in our debug. console let me just. take this up you can see that we first. go to the uh we print from Constructor. which is from your which proves that uh. the Constructor is uh run first. after that create state is run as I said. before then the init State function is. run. and then did change dependencies as run. did update widget and dispose do not run. because we have not uh you know updated. any widget we have not replaced our. current widget with any other widget. also uh dispose is run after we need to. clear off something suppose I have my. socket over here. and I have initialized it I haven't uh. downloaded any sockets package yet but. I'm just showing it for the sake uh for. showing it that we can use dispose on. sockets and if we call dispose over here. it will not give us any error at all. and it will uh be a good thing for our. apps memory and we should always. unsubscribe from all the listeners that. we have so that it doesn't keep on going. and cause harm in our applications right. now if you prefer seeing this uh. stateful widget in a flowchart format. like we did for stateless widget here. you have it. so our state is first created then the. initi state function is run then our. build function is executed. then uh it checks if did update config. or set state in our app is called yeah. you might be familiar with stat State. that's why I have not included this in. my tutorial right now. so basically if you don't know what set. state is set State uh will help you to. rerun your build function again. so you can rerun this whole entire uh. function after calling such state so if. you want to update any value and show it. uh to the user on the screen you can. just use such State then uh if any of. these is called then it will again go. back and call our build function as we. can see in the flowchart over here. then we have our dispose function over. here and after that our app is cleared. off now the second app that we are going. to build is a weather app where things. are going to get a little bit more. complicated but not very complicated so. let's dive into it and first of all. let's just see a demo of what we are. going to build so this is the weather. app we want to build. at first we have the app bar or the. header kind of thing then we have the. temperature showing up in Mumbai you can. insert any place you want in degree. Fahrenheit it also tells you what type. of weather it is like if it's raining. sunny and it shows the appropriate. symbol for it then we get the weather. forecast since the time right now is 8. 40 AM it shows me the weather forecast. from 9 am to 9 PM with 3r interval then. we have additional information about. humidity when speed and pressure the. good thing about all of this is. this is not hard-coded like we did in. the currency converter app it is taking. actual data from the web and displaying. it over here so the actual weather in. Mumbai right now is 300.67 degree. Fahrenheit also I have the refresh. button here in case I want to rerun. everything and you see as soon as I. press refresh I get a loading indicator. and it pulls the actual data from the. web so for this purpose we are using an. API here and we learn how to do this in. flutter so let's go ahead and create a. weather app so the first step is going. to be to create a flutter project for it. so go ahead create your own flutter. project I'll CD to desktop which means. change the directory to desktop and. after that I'll run the flutter create. command for weather app all right. after that I can change the directory to. the weather app and as soon as I type. weather and press tab it will auto. complete it for me. and we'll type weather app for me. after this I want to open it in vs code. I can either go ahead and open Visual. Studio code like this and you know. close the current folder I'm in and just. drag this app right over here or what. you can do is type in code which will. open up vs code for you now if it. doesn't open up what you need to do is. press command shift p and vs code. then pass. code like this and you'll see this. command shell command install code. command and path once you click over. here. you'll be able to use code like this and. open Visual Studio code from the. terminal itself. Code full stop basically means that open. vs code for the current folder if we. were back in the desktop we would have. to do code dot slash weather app all. right and it will open up my weather app. in vs code gray now let's open it up. back. let's start running our app to see if. everything is all right here. and then we'll also migrate to the lib. folder in main.dot because I want to. make sure you understand the default. code for the counter app that's written. now that you know the very basics of. flutter. so at the top we have the run app and we. have my app it also extends the. stateless widget where we have material. app title this title basically tells you. the thing that shows up here in Android. devices for iOS it just. takes the thing that is mentioned in. info dot P list now what is info.plist. well if you press command p and type. info dot P list you'll see iOS slash. Runner all right this is present in the. iOS folder where they have defined the. name for our app which is the weather. app. so it takes the name from here if you. want to change the name of the iOS you. know this name here. you'll have to change it in iOS slash. Runner slash info dot P list. and for Android you can change it from. here awesome so our app is also running. now we have our theme here and it takes. a theme data then passes in a color. screen and passes in a seed color based. on which we have our entire design ready. then it also has use material 3 set to. true now there's. material 2 and material 3 which are. basically versions of material design. material 3 came out recently and flutter. has the option to use material 3 design. so this is how the app looks in material. 3 design and if I just remove it save it. this is how it looks in material too so. that is the difference between material. 3 and material 2. definitely I like. material 3 better but you can look for. yourself. and this is what team does when you. define a theme over here it sets up the. overall coloring scheme and let's say. typography all of that stuff for the. entire app if you want to go ahead and. change a one particular screen you can. do that but what theme does is set set. up for the entire app because that's. what material app is right. then we have home where we pass in my. home page and in my home page we extend. a stateful widget we have a title. which we are taking from The Constructor. which is flutter demo home page and it's. showing up in app bar so if we scroll. down we have Abba. where we have title text widget.title. but an interesting thing over here is. background color. what it does is theme dot off context to. go to the theme then use the color. scheme dot inverse primary so it's. basically going to this theme widget. right over here. then it's saying give me color schemes. inverse. primary property which is defined in the. color scheme if you scroll down you'll. see inverse primary now if you set. inverse primary color over here let's go. ahead and try it inverse primary colors. dot blue save it come over here you see. the I bar is now blue in color because. we are accessing color scheme dot. inverse primary when we don't specify. anything and just specify the seed color. it takes a light purple kind of shade. but when we specify the inverse primary. color it takes a different color. and this is what theme is all about you. set it somewhere like let's say you set. the theme over here and then The. Descendant widgets can use it or the. child widgets can use it. then we have Body Center column and Main. access alignment Dot Center because of. which these two things are showing up in. the center you can see a constant text. and a counter text. and that is why we have a stateful. widget here. also we have something known as a. floating action button which shows the. button over here. now if you wanted a normal button over. here you could use elevated or flat. button or text button. but since you want to use a button over. here it's better to use Floating Action. button which is provided as a property. on scaffold. and then you can Define The Floating. Action button. widget and then obviously just go ahead. and look out for yourself like whatever. named properties are there everything is. written pure English for you to. understand. we also have the tooltip property which. is basically like if you long press. you'll see this thing right here. increment text that is wall tool tip is. then you have the icon as the child. because of which we have this plus. button. and then we have on pressed increment. count and increment counter we are just. doing such state. and in there we are changing the value. of underscore counter. so that's our counter app now we're just. going to go ahead and remove everything. because we want to build our own weather. app. and now let's start from scratch I hope. you understood everything in the counter. app because you've learned so much about. stateless stateful set State everything. now let's go ahead and create a class. I'm not deleting the main function. we'll have a class called my app. or you can call it weather app whatever. you want to call it this this today. should extend stateless widget. and instead of doing all of this we can. just do stateless widget like this. and call Maya cool now you're having a. placeholder here because of which we. have this lines over here placeholder is. basically telling that hey you want. something to be put up over here so I'll. just put it up for you. like this so it indicates that you want. to put some kind of widget here. and this should take this much space. this much height you see we have. fallback width and fallback height. stroke width and all of that stuff but. instead of returning a placeholder we. want to return a material app. and in material app we first want to set. the home which is. let's say constant where the screen and. that's something I want to create. so let's minimize the iOS folder go to. the left folder create one more file and. let's call this weather underscore. screen dot Rod remember the name in. convention here. then we are going to import material dot. so let's go ahead and import material. dot dot. then we will go into create. a state less widget let's say because I. don't know if I need to put a state or. not so for now let's put a stateless. widget here then we'll save it I'll take. this weather screen put it here. then press command full stop so that I. get a list of quick fixes where I can. import my weather screen package all. right. then another thing that I want to do is. after I save it you see this debug. Banner is showing this tells that our. app is in debug board but for now I just. want to remove it completely so what I. can do is debug show check mode manner. set it to false with this property set. to false. the debug. Banner over here is removed. and the last thing that I want to set. over here is the theme so right now my. theme is going to be light mode. so if I just return let's say a scaffold. here you'll understand what I'm talking. about. it's light mode right I want to change. it to dark mode so I can just do it in. theme otherwise I'll have to do it in. the background color yeah so we have. colors.black but what if my weather. screen or my weather app has more than. just one page do I have to go about and. change the background color everywhere. remember our diagram. the theme over here is going to set it. for the entire app it's going to be the. global thing but for weather screen in. the scaffold it's just going to be there. for one particular page. and now you might be able to see the. results but. it doesn't set it for the entire app. it's just for one screen so what I want. to do is go to the main dot dot set the. theming up so I'm going to have theme. data. and then you can pass in theme data but. what I want to do is use the preset. themes given which is theme data dot doc. or light mode. you can use either of them. or you can just Define your custom theme. data. all of these work all right with custom. theme data you can go and set your. background color you can set much more. stuff but that's not what I'm going to. do I'm not going to start writing from. scratch I'm just going to use theme data. dot dot. with Doc I have access to the dark. background you see but still this is. theme data.doc and this is fine but I. want to use material 3 because I like. that very much so you see it has a named. property of use material 3.. I can pass and use material 3 and it. requires a Boolean value so I can set it. to true. and it will start using material 3 and. you see the background color over here. changes now at if at all you want to. change the background color what you can. do is dot copy with and set your own. custom stuff over here so it will have. the dark color properties and. if you want to change anything at all. you can change it with copy width. so let's say the Abba color over here is. blue it's not actually blue but let's. say in theme data.doc the app bar color. is blue you want it to set it to White. you can just go ahead and set the Abba. theme over here. so what it will do is copy everything. from theme data.doc including app bar. then it will see this copy with function. and it will override the existing app. bar theme with the app bar theme I. provide over here. all right. so it just takes this and copies. whatever is present inside of it with. the existing theme data so I hope that. makes sense it's quite intuitive but I. don't want anything like that I just. want this simple line to be present all. right now let's go to the weather screen. and designer app now what do I want the. first thing that I require is an app bar. so with me I have the iOS screenshot. here now what I'm going to do is go over. it step by step and we'll see how to. make this kind of UI if you want to try. it on your own go ahead try it it will. be a good learning but if you can't. let's design it on our own we'll get. some practice and maybe after that you. can start designing your own stuff. because this is going to have many. important widgets discovered. so the first thing that I require is an. app bar with a title weather app so we. are going to go ahead and have an app. bar pass in app bar maybe already seen. and you see as soon as I collab I have. to remove constant from here because. Abba isn't a constant you can see it. inside of here in the Constructor no. cons. now we want the title which will be a. constant text and we're going to call. this let's say weather app let's go. ahead and type it. save it and we see whether operating. over here perfect. now still the textile doesn't look very. good because this is bolded so let's go. ahead and set the textile Vilas Style. textile. font weight to be font weight dot bold. we've seen exactly this and this is nice. the next thing I want is a refresh. button over here also I want to make. sure that my title is always centered. irrespective of whether it is on Android. or iOS so I'm going to set Center title. to true. great no visible changes but on Android. you'll see the change. now the next thing I want is a refresh. icon over here. how to add that now I told you in the. first app that whenever you want to add. any icons over here or any sort of. widget we have to use the actions. property present inside of the app bar. so we are going to use exactly that we. are going to have actions and here we. are going to mention our icon which is. going to be icons dot refresh. Also let's put a constable here save it. and we have our icon showing up. but the problem with it is this icon is. not clickable. you know if I click on it it does. absolutely nothing. I want to make sure that it still does. something whenever I click on it. so for that we'll need an on tap. property and like some sort of detector. that hey this has been clicked so for. this we need to use a button right. not always you can use a button over. here but sometimes you just don't want. to use a button what you want to use. instead is an icon wrapped with. a widget known as gesture detector so. you can press Ctrl shift r on Mac and. then you'll get these refactoring. options and you can wrap with something. known as a gesture detector. and gesture detector isn't a constant so. let's remove it let's put const for our. icon. now we'll put a comma so that the. formatting takes place and we get in a. format like this. now what I want to do is use some of the. property given by gesture detector which. is on tap. with ontap we have access to the click. property so whenever we click on this. we can run a particular function just. like we do in a button so we can have. the ontar property defined here and. let's say print refresh. let's save it press Ctrl command J. restart an entire app let's click over. here and it says refresh. again if we click it says refresh so. this is being clicked on but one problem. I have is there is no splash effect. like when I click on it there should be. some kind of radial Splash shown so for. that kind of detection what I want to do. is wrap it with inquel Widget Inkwell. also has. similar set of properties it doesn't. have as advanced properties as a gesture. detector it has lesser properties than. gesture detector but what Inkwell does. is give you a splash effect so when you. click on this you get this nice Splash. effect. so you can use either of them. in this scenario and it will work fine. I'm going to go ahead with gesture. detector and be done but. there's another thing you can do instead. of using gesture detector and icon we. have something known as an icon button. so. it is an icon and a button so it allows. you to pass the on press property and an. icon so in our icon we are going to have. icon icons dot refresh. and then you have the on press property. so you can do the same task in multiple. ways and you can have the same UI. it depends on you what you want to do. but with icon button basically you have. the nice cool Splash effect which is not. a not a square it is a circle plus you. get the nice padding overall. in gesture detector and I can you would. have to set your own padding property so. that it didn't get stuck in the right. hand corner with icon button it provides. you with. the padding by itself cool now we are. done with the Abba now let's get to the. body and make some stuff so the first. thing I want to make is this big bulk. right here we're not going to actually. get some data as of right now we're. going to put in some false data here. and when we connect to an API which is. after creating our UI. we'll replace all the values but as of. right now. we are going to put in random values so. let's go ahead in our scaffold. we are in a scaffold let's make sure. and then here we are going to pass a. body property and in a body what do we. require well. first thing to analyze is the proper. layout what is the layout of this app. well everything is below one another in. a vertical manner so obviously we need. to use columns so that we have access to. children and because of that we can put. everything inside of one. particular widget. and it should be vertically below each. other. so let's go ahead and pass a column over. here column will have children. and the first child is going to be this. main card. so let's put a comment here saying main. card so that we know what we need to. work on. then if you want you can put in a. placeholder here saying that hey. this much space is going to be given to. our. main card. now to change the height you know it's. taking a lot of height maybe you can go. ahead and change the properties here and. the property I want to change is. fallback height so let's change it to. let's say. 250 and maybe it takes this much space. which is fine. and in the child we are going to pass in. a constant text saying. main card save it come over here you see. main card but now the fallback height. and fallback width will disappear why. because you've said the child as a text. now this parent will take only as much. height and width as this text requires. as much as a child requires this is not. height but fallback height fallback. height is basically like hey you haven't. mentioned any child if you haven't. mentioned any child this is the height. we are going to go to but if you have. mentioned a child we are going to take. as much speed as the child requires so. if we remove the child and come over. here this looks great all right. now after that the second thing we. require is where the forecast cards. we need these cards over here right. so where the forecast cards again you. can place a placeholder here. and let's say the fallback height is 150. looks good enough maybe we need a sizing. wire so we'll have constant size box. height 10 which will help us to leave. spacing we've already seen this before. but this is two lesser space so let's go. ahead and add 20 let's say this looks. good and after that we'll have. additional information so again we'll. leave some height. and then we'll have a placeholder again. let's say 150 again. so this is the overall layout of our app. very simply laid out first we are going. to have our main card then we are going. to have our weather forecast cards and. after that. we are going to have our additional. information. so let's get started by designing. everything. the first thing we need to design is the. main card so how is our main card going. to look like well let's analyze it. it does have a color of its own. it does have a 3d effect. it has its nice own curves. because if we just use a container which. would be the first thing that goes in. our mind that hey this is a very big. thing and it has these curves. it has a color. it requires a children over here like we. want to display a text we want to. display an icon we want to display again. a text. so the first thing that might come in. our mind is a container. but it has an elevation and container. doesn't have an elevation property so. definitely we cannot use a container. however what we can use is something. known as a card widget so if we just use. a card widget we'll be able to use it. now as soon as you have a card you know. one placeholder goes away but now let's. start designing a car. in a card. we require these three children. so we need degree Fahrenheit text we. need this thing right here and we need. drain. so in a card we are going to have a. child property. we are going to we are going to have a. column and here we are going to mention. children obviously because everything in. is in a vertical format. so you want a column over here without. column you won't get access to Children. you can use row which will also give you. access to children but it will be in a. horizontal manner we don't want that. so we'll use column aware. now we need text so we are going to pass. in a text and the text is going to be. let's say. 300 Fahrenheit now I also want access to. degree. but there's no degree sign on my. keyboard at least what I can see so what. I'm going to do is go to Google search. for degree symbol and just copy the. degree from here. close my Safari tab. have 300 degree Fahrenheit like this and. we see 300 degree Fahrenheit cool. let's put a comma so that we have a. formatting in place. perfect. now I want to design this further now. first of all let's go ahead and increase. the font size and the font weight of our. temperature so we're going to have style. textile and the textile is going to be. font size 32 font weight font weight dot. bull I want it bolded and this font size. is a tried and tested value I've built. this app before so I know I want the. font size of 32 but when I was building. this app I constantly tried and see saw. what font size I preferred and this is. the font size I prefer now if you look. closely at it you'll see there's some. sort of background on it that is quite. evident and that is our card widget card. gives us access to an elevation stuff. which. you can see over here. and you can toggle it on or off like if. you want elevation to be zero it will be. completely gone but if you remove this. it has some sort of elevation of its own. now we have a card but the problem right. now is the card is not taking the. maximum width it is only taking as much. of it as this text requires so what I. can do is wrap my card with a container. which will tell it to take the maximum. width. so for this I'll press Ctrl shift R get. the refactoring options and wrap it with. container and here I'm going to mention. the width which is going to be double. dot Infinity saying that hey take. maximum amount of width and you see it. takes the maximum amount of width. however we have a warning here I mean. the entire app isn't warning but even. here we have a warning saying use a size. box to add white space to a layout so. whenever you want to set up width as. I've already told you before you always. need to use size box. when you have to use something more than. just a width or a height let's say color. border radius all of those stuff you. have to use container then but then. but if it's only with then go ahead with. size box. and we see the same thing. now the width is stretched it takes the. maximum amount of width possible so I. hope you are understanding how flutter. layouts work. earlier we had not set any width. constraints on this card. it was free to use whatever space it. required. and therefore it depended on its child. and its child was column columns width. depends on its children and its child. required only this much space but then. we added. a constraint on our card saying that hey. take the maximum amount of width. possible so it went ahead and took. double dot Infinity which has the. maximum amount of space it can take. right. so keep this layout thing in mind. because it's the most important aspect. of flutter you need to understand how. layout and UI work now the problem is. it's taking the maximum amount of space. I do want it to leave spacing from here. and if you see in a layout everything in. our column takes this amount of space so. I think on the column property they have. set the padding property padding is not. specific to One widget that hey only. this much only this widget requires. spacing from here not these widgets well. all of the widgets required the spacing. from here so we can safely assume that. we can set the padding property on this. column. not on One widget of course you can go. ahead and set padding property on every. widget in our chat in our column but it. would make much more sense to do it for. the entire column so we can have Ctrl. shift R then we are going to wrap it. with padding and we are going to set it. to let's say 16.. because it's much more than just eight. it would be somewhere over here and 16. is over here which looks good. great now you see there is spacing over. here here everywhere that's good. now let's put more children to our. column we are going to have our icon now. so we are going to have icon icons Dot. Cloud as of now it's going to be a. static value so let's put a cloud and. the size is quite small so let's. increase its size so we're going to have. a size of 32. it's still small nothing big so let's go. ahead with 48. still quite small and let's go ahead. with 64.. now it looks big enough. so we can go ahead with this. also if you want to increase the height. of your emulator you can do it by. stretching it then after this icon what. we require is this subtext so let's put. that you're going to have text. drain. style is going to be let's say textile. font size. 16 let's go ahead with that. it's quite small what my thought process. is is like hey this is almost 32 then. this is 64 and this is very small. compared to both of these things so we. can go ahead and let's say set the font. size to 20 so it will look decent enough. in front of them. and I think that looks good so we have. the content inside of the card setup. but if you see there's much more spacing. over here. between these things so we can set that. up as well we are going to have a. constant sized box of height 16 and. don't worry about the errors if you are. concerned about them because these. errors will go away as soon as you put a. const for example if I just put a. constable here most of the errors just. go away right. I am not putting them because. I know that later on I want to set a. border radius property and Border radius. as you know border radius dot circular. is not a constant if it's not a constant. I cannot set it. to a constant right so instead of doing. and wasting time setting up cons what. I'm going to do is let the warnings be. there. and wait for the Border radius property. to be set up so that we can put a nice. curve over here. so we've put a size box over here this. leaves a good spacing we're going to do. that again after the cloud icon that's. nice. now if you compare it to this. in layout terms it looks quite similar. except. if you see over here there's pacing if. you see over here there's spacing but. here there is no spacing added over here. so there are two options we can take in. the column we can set the size box over. here. as the first child in a column and at. the end again. or you can just wrap this column. property with. padding again. and this padding is limited only to our. column so I'm going to go ahead with the. column property because I don't like. putting size boxes where it's not. actually necessary so I'm going to go. ahead and press Ctrl shift r. ape it with padding and it's going to be. Edge and such dot all. 16 save it come over here and this looks. better definitely. the next thing I require is the. elevation to be bigger as you can see. the Shadows are bigger so let's go ahead. and set our custom elevation property. for our card which is going to be. elevation let's say 10. when we do that. this is much stronger and appears more. 3D it gives a better visual effect. the next thing we want to do is. set a nice border radius it should be. more curved than what we have right now. so in our card we can go ahead and set. the shape property where it requires a. border and here we can pass in a rounded. rectangular border what we've already. seen before right most of the widgets. are repeating we did learn a new thing. about a card. but rest of the things are quite similar. you just need to understand what you. need to do and start doing it for. yourself and you see as soon as I put. track rounded rectangular border and. save it I get. a pointy border because I need to custom. set my border radius over here so I'll. go ahead and set my border radius to. border radius. dot circular and as soon as I do border. radius dot circular the warnings should. go away and here my border radius is. going to be 16 and as soon as I do that. look there's more curve attached over. here that looks perfect. the warnings go away from here. however there are warnings over here so. let's go ahead and put Constable let's. remove unnecessary cons. because their parent is a constant cool. so we have this thing over here it. doesn't look very same to this. but it does have the proper layout the. thing that we are missing is the nice. merging filter between them right now. it's clearly visible that hey there's an. elevation property and doesn't merge. with the background. to make it merge with the background. like this we need to have access to One. widget. which is. a backdrop filter what backdrop filter. will do is basically. blur the background in the X and Y. directions so X will be the horizontal. Direction y will be the vertical. Direction think of it in graph and blur. the background. and once it blurs the background you'll. have a nice effect. let's see what I'm talking about if I. just wrap my. padding Widget the column is wrapped by. padding and if we wrap the padding. widget with. backdrop filter we get access to the. named parameter of filter. and here we need to pass an image filter. so we need to pass an image filter and. if we do this much it's not allowed. because image filter is not an abstract. class but it doesn't have a Constructor. of its own or actually. it is an abstract class and it doesn't. have a Constructor of its own meaning. this abstract class. cannot be extended you see. so having something like this image. filter dot underscore and then. parenthesis basically means that this. Con the. Constructor of this abstract class. cannot be called any time. that's why I said this is not an. abstract class it's it just has its. Constructor privatized. but in reality this is an abstract class. whose Constructor is also privatized you. know privatized as always by underscore. so they've put an underscore over there. okay. so let's come back over here and use. image filter dot because we know image. filter is not extended if it's not. extended there can be no class we can. put here except image filter itself. that's why I call Image filter Dot. now if you didn't understand what I was. talking about what I was saying is image. filter is basically a privatized. Constructor so that means image filter. cannot be a parent class of any other. class because extended is not allowed. so definitely I cannot put anything else. over here I need to put image filter. only. so I called image filter Dot and that. gives us access to multiple methods we. can use. you can use blur compose dilate erode. I'm going to go ahead with blur that. will blur my background. and here I can pass in Sigma X which. will be let's say 10. and if you hover over this you see. creates an image filter that applies a. gaussian blur and then we have Sigma Y. which is again going to be 10. so from. the X and Y direction we want 10 and you. see. it basically merges with the background. but then its elevation kind of goes away. to prevent that we can add. a border radius property to this. backdrop filter itself. so you can press Ctrl shift R then wrap. it with a clip or rect widget which. allows you to put a border radius. property if you wrap it again with a. card so that you can set up order radius. property it wouldn't make sense what you. need to do is put clip rack what clip RX. will do is clip it clip it according to. the properties you mentioned and it. allows you to put border radius. and it also has a custom Clipper you can. pass in but right now we just want to. put a border radius for that clip our. wrecked is enough so you can put border. radius. and Border radius is going to be the. same thing as this one if it is. different values it will look a bit. weird and you see as soon as we add. border radius the elevation properties. there and we get a nice cool effect. looking like this card. so I hope you understand what I did over. here I applied a backdrop filter because. of which everything was leveled into one. place and there was blur over here then. I wrapped it with a clip rack widget. because of which it applied its own. border radius it separated the blur. from the background and gave it a nice. look. so we have a nice little. backdrop filter as well as the Border. radius which looks exactly like this. widget now I know this is an important. or a difficult concept to grasp but you. can play around with yourself you know. you can just remove this widget again. and see how it looks after adding lip RX. widget you'll again see how it looks. great so we have our main card design. angle and in my opinion it looks just. perfect. now let's go ahead and design the. weather forecast and additional. information tabs. so for weather forecast we have to leave. some spacing which we've already done I. assume here we have it. size box height 20. after that I need a text saying weather. forecast. so I'm going to have a constant text. saying whether for cast. save it and when you have an error and. you save it. it doesn't hot reload but when you save. it after no errors you see where the. forecast over here. now let's put style over here we are. going to have style as textile then we. are going to have font size as 24 which. is a big value then font weight which is. going to be font weight dot bold. and we have our weather forecast showing. up over here which looks good. now what I want to do is it is mentioned. in the center I want to take it to the. left hand side so for that I can wrap my. text widget. in a widget known as align. what align does is basically certain. alignment of where you want it to be in. the column do you want it in the left. view do you want it in the center you. want it in the right top right whatever. and align has alignment property now. instead of using a line you can go ahead. and use container which also has an. alignment property but at the end of the. day container inside uses alignment. or align widget which is the same thing. so let's go ahead and pass alignment. now alignment requires alignment. geometry but its default value is. alignment Dot Center we can set it to a. different value by using alignment Dot. and you see we have a bunch of options. bottom center bottom left bottom right. center Center left center right top. Center top left top right what I want to. do is. Center in the left hand side. so I'm going to use Center left save it. and we have it displayed over here. now instead of doing this alignment Dot. Center left what you could do is. remove the Align widget go to your. column. this column not this column that we have. over here this column is related to. these things over here we want to go to. the column that controls all of these. things. and here set the cross access alignment. to cross access alignment dot start as. soon as you do that everything starts. from the left hand side. from here. so as I've already mentioned before and. I'll do it again if you've forgotten. main axis is this thing right over here. and cross axis is everything from year. to year. so when we set cross access alignment. dot start everything starts from here if. I set it to cross access alignment dot. end everything from will start from here. okay. the difference between using a line. widget over here and using cross access. alignment is this cross access alignment. will set it for all the descending. widgets for these cards that we'll. display for additional information for. these things over here but. align only sets it for one particular. widget in our case that was the weather. forecast widget. cool. so let's go down we have our weather. forecast looks good. now we are going to have our size box. again so we are going to set a size box. of height 20 again. save it. then what we want is a list of widgets. showing up over here and how this works. is. something like this this is scroll level. okay because there are more than. three things that we want to display on. the screen together and we still want to. display more stuff. so it is scrollable over here so I want. that scrollable thing to be present how. can I do that well I can put a row that. would be good. and inside of the row I can display. these cards that sounds good so let's go. ahead and create a row. in our row we are going to have children. and my first child is going to be well. this thing over here. so I have to design this component on my. own. so let's go ahead and Design This so we. are going to have well again a card. because it has an elevation and this. sort of looks like a card only just like. we had before right it has elevation of. its own so it gives like a. 3D visual it's coming on the top of your. screen and that is what a card is so we. can use a card again. then we can use a child. and the child is going to have. well a column directly which shows a. Time the cloud icon again and the. temperature. so we're going to have our child. column. then children and the first child is the. time so my time is let's say zero three. zero zero. let's save it come over here and we see. this perfect. but the problem right now. is my card only taking as much width as. my text require and definitely my text. is not going to require this much space. so what I can do is set a custom height. or width again so I'm going to wrap my. card widget with. a size box again where I'll set a custom. width to let's say 100 save it come over. here and this looks bigger nice. now after this text we are going to have. a sized box. but even before that let's go ahead and. set the properties of this text this. text is bigger in size than this thing. right here and it's also bolded so we. need to set two properties inside of the. style and we've done this so many times. I hope you can do this on your own in. the textile we are going to have font. size. and the font size is 16. font weight and. the font weight is fontway dot bull save. it come away and this looks good. now after this we leave our space again. so we have constant. size. box. and then we have our height set to 8 we. leave 8 spacing. and after that we need a cloud icon. again so we have icon icons dot cloud. and the size is let's say 32.. save it and we'll have a cloud icon if. we remove the size icon and just display. it it's quite small and since I know. it's small I set it to 32 but it really. all depends on how you want it to look. it can look a different and you'll be. fine with it but I like this look better. I'm trying to replicate what I just. created over here. in our third app we're going to design a. dribble UI. so you'll understand how to create one. specific UI but this weather page is. your own creativity so you can just do. whatever you want I'm going to follow. this kind of design. again we use a spacing and to be. consistent with what we used above I'm. just going to copy paste my size box. and then we are going to use the. temperature so I'm going to copy this. text now paste it over here and let's. say my temperature is. 320. save it. and this is bolded I don't want it. boldered. Also let's put decimal aware 320.12. let's remove bold save it. and it's quite big if you can see over. here closely look at it this text is. bigger than this text. why it's not because it's bolded it's. because its font size is bigger so we. need to reduce its font size let's try. to remove this textiles totally. and then we are able to match it this. looks better in my opinion. all right so I'm going to use this. now after this. um. I do want padding to be present just. like we had in this card it's a total. replica if you want to call that so. let's go ahead and wrap our column with. a padding property so we are going to. have. our column wrapped with. padding and padding is going to have. Edge in search dot all it save it and. you'd see it right over here looks good. and this looks just like how this looks. also the elevation is kind of small I. just realized so let's. increase the elevation as well to six. then it looks much better and much. similar to what we have already. and one last thing that is there is the. Border radius this border radius is more. curved and this is slightly less curved. so we want to set a border radius on. this card. so we can either wrap the padding widget. with a clip or Rec widget again so that. we have the nice padding or we can just. remove this padding and wrap it with. container then you pass a border radius. property to it now container doesn't. have a border radius property mentioned. over here you can check for yourself. but what it does have is decoration and. what it requires is box decoration. it requires just a decoration but if you. try to create just a decoration that's. not allowed because it's an abstract. class what you can use instead is box. decoration and we've seen this class. before where in. Cupertino design when we were trying to. design something we had to pass in. decoration. remember the text field that we add. Cupertino text field that had a. decoration or a style property that. required box decoration and we passed in. box decoration that's exactly what we. need to pass in over here and then we. can pass in the Border radius which has. about radius dot circular. to let's say 12 or 10 or 16 whatever you. want. try test it on your own just see what. you like and use it don't blindly follow. what I'm following. because you're building an app for. yourself you want it to look how you. think it should look so this looks more. curved now and that's good. however this card doesn't look as good. as this one why. because if you'll see. this text has more padding. and you can increase the padding over. here let's go ahead and set it to let's. say 18. save it and you have more. padding but it still doesn't feel as. good the reason for that is quite simple. we have set a restriction over here that. your width should be 100 no matter what. the width should be 100 for the card now. if I remove this. and you know let's set it back to 12. again. we have a card looking like this and it. doesn't look very good. that's why we had set the size box to a. card in the first place. but even with that. we are just saying that hey the card. should have a width of 100 that's not. what we want. because then we are limiting the height. of the card what I want to do is set the. content inside of it to have a width of. 100 so what I'm going to do is wrap this. column with a width and since we already. have a container we don't have to wrap. it with the size box we can just mention. the width property over here and set it. 200.. and once we do that you see this card. looks much better than we what we had. before. other problem that I have right now is. there's too much spacing over here that. this card feels disconnected from. weather forecast it doesn't feel that. this is a better forecast it just feels. like this is a thing of its own so let's. reduce the size box height over here. let's set it to 16.. and then it looks much better otherwise. it just feels disconnected from where. the forecast text. simple now what we want to do is take. this card and paste it five times right. so we can have one two three four five. save it. and we have the cards showing up nicely. but the problem is. they are exceeding the limit of the. screen obviously. why wouldn't they exceed the limit of. the screen we only have space for 4.5. or 3.5 cards plus we have a padding. property over here which restricts it. even more right we have. over here in the top of the column. padding. agencies.all 16. so we are leaving a. padding of 16 from here because of which. our cards can only come till here so. that's why we had this now how can I. make these. cards not these cards this entire row. scroll level so for that we have a. widget we can just press Ctrl shift R. then we'll have rapid widget and we have. a widget known as single child scroll. View. when we use this widget whatever child. we have inside of this is scrollable and. when we save it. you see it's not really scrollable even. after hot restarting and that's because. it has a direction of its own it is. scrollable only in the vertical. Direction but not in the horizontal. Direction so we can change its scroll. Direction over here so we have scroll. Direction access dot horizontal and once. we do that the error goes away and this. thing right here is scrollable. so with single child scroll view you're. basically telling that hey whatever. widget you have and it exceeds a certain. width. or a certain size you can wrap it with. single child scroll View and it will. make the entire screen scrollable. and that's quite convenient. and this is single child scroll view. because it only has one child and its. one child is a row. now if you want multiple. child scroll view you can look for. multi-child scroll view but there's. nothing like it because most of the. times you'll only need a single child. scroll view because then you can pass in. a child and then your row column widgets. whatever you want. okay. so let's go down and we have our stuff. over here but you'll see we have to. scroll much below just to see one card. widget and since we are used reusing the. same card everywhere. it causes a problem for us. what problem let's say I want to change. the size of this icon I change I want to. change it to let's say 40. I want to. make it look bigger. now what happens is. when I change it over here I only change. it for one card I have to change it for. all the other cards. so I'll have to go ahead copy this for T. paste it over here over. here over. here and there's a possibility I miss. out on something. also since you have warnings I want to. make sure that everything is constant. over here so the warnings go away so I. have to manually do it for every single. card. now that's not suitable is it. so what I can do is extract this widget. out of here also press command Z to set. it back to the original height because. this size 32 is perfect for me. so coming back to what I was talking. what I can do is extract this card. widget into a separate class of its own. that way I can just return. One widget and I have a single source of. control if I want to change how a cloud. looks I can change it in one particular. widget itself I don't have to go ahead. and change it every single place just. like we did in Border remember when we. had our currency converter material page. and we had a border for our text field. we made a variable that made sure. that you can have it over here. now what I'm going to do is instead of. creating a variable I'm going to create. a particular widget of its own so that I. can store it. so what I'm going to do is take this. card. control X. then go outside of this class and create. a stateless widget. let's go outside of this class not. inside of this class here we are going. to create stateless widget. and then we are going to call this. widget. early. forecast. item all right this is what I'm going to. call it why because it shows me the. forecast for every r as simple. now. I can copy this card I think I already. copied it but let's just do it again. let's return a card from here then put a. constant Also let's remove the. unnecessary constant from size box. because their parent is a constant. itself. now we can take this early forecast item. instead of returning a card I'm going to. return Ali forecast item. instead of returning a card again I'm. going to return an Ali forecast item. let's copy this. again instead of returning a card Ali. forecast item instead of returning a. card. hourly forecast item. so we have our four hourly forecast. items we are missing one let's put. another one so we have five cards. perfect. so we have our layout done for this as. well then next thing is the last section. the additional information section so. similarly we are going to remove this. placeholder now no need for that we. already have that the last thing is this. additional information we're going to. leave a size box of height 20. Also let's put a cons for the entire. single child scroll View. no errors now you see perfect then we. need a text again which has the same. height as the weather forecast so I'm. going to copy paste it. and call this additional. information. save it come back over here and there we. have it now I challenge you to make this. on your own we have sufficient knowledge. of what we need to do do you have to use. a card do you have to use something else. you have your own knowledge for this so. go ahead and try it out on your own and. let me know in the comment section if. you were able to do it. now your code doesn't have to match mine. if it looks similar then it's all good. if it doesn't. then maybe you can copy my code however. it's always good that you try it on your. own. so let's go ahead and create first of. all a row. and even before that let's put a height. over here. constant size box height 16 and after. that I'm going to have a row where we. are going to have children and the first. child is going to be. our first additional information item. which is this thing right here so. since they are vertically laid out I am. just going to put in a column so we have. a column. in our column we have children in our. children we have an icon at first. and the icon is icons Dot. and this is kind of like. a drop icon. so let's search for something icons dot. water water is kind of like a wave so. let's put drop. there's nothing like Drop maybe water. drop and we have water drop exactly like. this thing okay cool. so we have our icon over here and what. I'm going to do is make sure my icon is. as big as this icon there's consistency. in our UI which is good so we are going. to have a size of 32 which increases its. height. then we are going to leave some spacing. again constant size box height eight. again consistency even here we had a. spacing of eight same thing we are doing. then we have our text which says what's. the. label for this so like what is the thing. we are showing we're showing humidity. so let's have that. save it. looks good enough. if we just scroll this back to the. normal. thing yeah I think they're pretty much. the same after this we can again leave a. height. and then we need. the value like what's the value of this. humidity let's go ahead with 91. product. text. then we need a style and this is. definitely bigger so we just want to. leave textile. font size 16 save it 91.. but this is not bolded so let's go ahead. and bold it now you understand what I'm. doing it's the same thing we are doing. repeatedly because these are a very few. widgets that continuously keep repeating. row column icon text. icon button gesture detector Inkwell. container size box you know same things. keep repeating for 90 of the uis things. like backdrop filter come once in a. while. so you don't have to worry about. those kind of widgets okay so we have. humidity over here and again the same. logic. if I want to change the design of. this thing I'll have to. change it three different times if I. paste it like this you know since I want. three columns over here I'll have to. keep pasting it again and again. so instead what I can do is put it in a. widget of its own. and I can do it right over here but the. problem I'm facing right now is I can. stack everything up in one single file. but does that make sense if I put. everything in one file not really. so I'm going to put everything in. different files all right so I'm going. to go to the left folder I have whether. forecast item dot dot import. flutter material dot over here then I'm. going to paste it. Ali forecast item not weather forecast. so let me rename this. to. early forecast item good naming is a. must when it comes to programming just. like variables. then we can press command full stop it. tells us to import Ali forecast item. let's do that save it then we can copy. this. column make sure you copy this entire. column. and we can create a widget of its own. now there's a trick you can do instead. of creating it on yourself you can press. Ctrl shift r. then you say extract widget give the. widget its name the name of this widget. is going to be additional. info item. not N4 info item and you see it creates. a widget by itself. it also automatically puts additional. info item over here let's put a const. let's remove size box from here. save it and we'll take this in a. separate file of its own again so we. have additional. info. item dot dot we can import flutter. not physics dot dot material dot dot now. you might say hey this is quite. redundant and why do you have to. continuously keep doing it well that's. because when more Engineers are working. segregation of files and having one. particular component in one file will. make much more sense than having. everything stuck together in one file. what would happen if I just stuck. everything in just main.dot file it. wasn't a good thing. so I'm sticking everything in one. particle of. file of its own. now let's import this thing right here. by pressing command full stop again. and let's put additional info item three. times. cool now the problem here is everything. is stuck together so do I have to add a. padding widget not exactly because. padding widget will. not make sure that they are spaced out. evenly if you see aware everything is. spaced out evenly. what can I do such that just paste. evenly so for that row gives us a. property in its mean access alignment. which we then discuss remember we add. main access alignment Dot and we add a. bunch of options over here Center was. basically centering everything end was. basically taking everything to the end. start was. putting everything to the start but. there were three options that we didn't. talk about space around space between. space evenly because those required you. to have multiple components and in our. app. in our first app we didn't have those. components. and when we did have those components. like text text field and button I forgot. to mention it so here I'm mentioning it. and this same thing is even there for. our column all right. we'll take a look after we take a look. at this main access alignment properties. so first option we have is space around. what happens in space around is you tell. it to space around each and everything. so there's space away or space over here. then for this widget also space away. your space aware. then for this widget also space away or. space away up. to use space. around all of the widgets what happens. in space between is. everything. is spaced between those widgets it's not. around it's not happening in both the. direction the space is not being left. from here and your both it's only being. left from here. here. so it's around. so for the starting widget it's going to. be only here for the middle widget is. going to be year and year and for the. ending widget it's only going to be from. here that's what space around is. or space between us. space around says to leave space around. everything space between says that hey. leave space between everything I hope. English makes sense you know. it's all in the English and then we have. space evenly what we require. it spaces evenly everything but to be. honest face evenly doesn't look as good. as space around so I'm just going to. keep space around all right. now you can use space evenly if you like. that design I like this much better. because there's much more spacing and. much more clarity now the benefit of. using main axis alignment and not using. padding is if I have four widget let's. say it automatically adjusts. I don't have to add a padding to the. fourth widget over here if I have a. fifth widget. you see it automatically adjusts. according to the conditions that's the. good thing about it. but anyways I only need three things. great so I have our entire UI created. and it looks awesome in my opinion but. if you see additional information. doesn't have that much of height over. here this does have so you can reduce it. to Heights to let's say eight and this. will look better also for weather. forecast if you want to. decrement this size you can go ahead and. decrement that let's say put 8. and that will look better for you. so yeah this is our UI design perfect. now to show you the column thing that I. was talking about column has the same. main access alignment properties if you. have main access alignment dot start or. dot space around let's say everything is. spaced around in the entire screen first. widget over here then spacing so that. space around. again space around so this space around. every single widget here. if we have space between. the space between all of the widgets and. it looks quite similar to space around. then we have space evenly. this also looks quite similar but there. is some change. so my point is you have the same stuff. you can do in Center everything gets. centered but for me I want the default. option of main access alignment dot. start because that looks perfect. great. what I want to do is make sure that. everything can have a different value of. its own right now what we are doing is. saying that hey additional info item is. going to have. humidity text it's going to have the. water drop icon is going to have this. constant text whenever you initialize. additional info item these are the. things that get created. unlike the design over here I cannot put. wind speed I cannot put pressure I. cannot put all of that stuff. because whenever I create this widget we. have this stuff displaying. So to avoid that what I can do is take. everything here from The Constructor. why because every time you initialize 10. you ask what the icon should be what the. label should be what the value should be. and that's exactly what we want we want. different items for every time we create. an additional info item so let's go. ahead and create a Constructor how do we. create a Constructor now. well first of all we Mark every widget a. final because. it's a widget right and widget are. immutable especially stateless widget. and even stateful widgets are immutable. all widgets are immutable so we need to. have final for all our properties so. we're going to have final I can data. because I can requires icon data. then we are going to ask for the icon. and we are not going to initialize. anything because if we initialize then. we are itself giving it a value so it. doesn't make sense to put it over here. we can just put it over here we need to. ask it from The Constructor so we are. going to have required because this is a. named argument we have learned it in Dot. required this dot icon now I can take. this icon and pass it over here now you. see we get an error over here saying. that whenever you initialize additional. info item you need to pass your own icon. we get an error over here also saying. that hey you cannot put a const. because this is coming from the. Constructor and the value from The. Constructor can change. so this cannot be a constant it's a. dynamic value so let's put constant for. the size box. now even for this text we need to take. it from the. Constructor itself so let's take final. string label. then we have required this dot label so. I can ask for label over here. again this is dynamic so text constant. is not required. so any value that is coming from the. Constructor. cannot be a constant. then we need a value text so we have y. null string value required this dot. value. now I can take this value and paste it. over here. so text. string value is not is a is a. non-constant but textile can still be a. constant right. so we can put a constant over here. simple. and now with this we have access. to all of these properties over here so. every time you initialize additional. info item you need to pass in these. particular properties so let's go ahead. and pass icons dot water drop as the. first icon because our first thing is. going to be humidity. then our label which is going to be your. midday. and then finally the value which is. going to be. let's say in 91.. and when we come over here well the. error gets a result now we need to do it. two more times so our icon here label. here and value here is required now what. is our label. wind speed so let's go ahead and type. wind speed the icon for it is going to. be icons dot air because. that's what wind is. and then we are going to have. seven point. five let's say. then again we have to mention I can. label. value. so my value here is going to be let's. say 1000. pressure. and I didn't find any particular icon. for pressure. so what I did was go ahead and use icons. Dot. Beach. since I didn't find it if you have. anything related to pressure you can use. that but I like this much better. so you see everything has its own value. now same thing we are going to do with. the weather forecast as well. here in our Ali forecast item you'll see. every time we initialize it gets its own. static values we need to pass it from. The Constructor so that the values can. change every time we initialize so do. the exact same thing. pause the video try it on your own and I. hope you're able to do it if you're able. to do it then congrats you've understood. the entire concept if you're not then. maybe you need to re-watch the entire. thing. so I hope you were able to do it let's. go ahead and try it on your own and. early forecast icon item the first thing. we require is final string. time. then we need final. string temperature. then final icon data icon. now we need to mention required for all. but I have a trick for you you can press. this bulb icon add final field. parameters and it automatically adds. required Arguments for you. great saves a lot of time for us let's. go to the Ali forecast item and mention. it so we need to mention time time is. let's say 0 0 first. then we have. icon. it will be icons dot let's say it's. cloud. because it's raining. then the. temperature is going to be. what's the temperature over here. 301.22 let's save it I'm going to paste. it four more times so one two three four. let's remove them. so this will be 0 3 let's call it sunny. and let's say it's. 275. I hope 275 degree Fahrenheit is sunny. and I think. if I think about it 275 degrees. Fahrenheit is quite a lot of. heat it's more than 100 degree celsius. so we are making a mistake here instead. of 300 degree Fahrenheit we need 300. Kelvin that's what the correct thing is. so I apologize and I know you might be. thinking. all the time that hey this is incorrect. it's not actually in degree Fahrenheit. it's actually in kelvin I misinterpreted. it so my bad so anyways uh let's go back. to our stuff 275 is not at all Sunny so. let's go ahead with. 300.52. then 301.22 then. 302.22 let's call this sunny again. we have. 300.12 and finally. 304.12. then also change the time zero three. zero six. zero nine. and twelve. so yeah we are able to change everything. let's also put. everything over here so time over here. is going to be time. I can here is going to be icon and. the text here is going to be temperature. constant. let's put everywhere. constant now if you're wondering how I. selected multiple cursors at a time I. did that by pressing option so when you. select one place put option on another. put option on another and then you're. able to do it that's how I do it on Mac. I'm not sure about Windows but you can. Google it. okay now let's restart it and there we. have it. that's our app perfect now again I. apologize and you know I had been. thinking it wrong it's not actually. degree Fahrenheit it's Kelvin because it. makes more sense degree Fahrenheit would. mean that this is like over 100 degrees. Celsius and that just doesn't make sense. right so this is Kelvin which basically. means that it's 27 degrees Celsius. Also let's correct the spelling of. humidity there. Okay cool so yeah we are done with the. basic structure of the app now the next. thing is to get data from API. from the web so that I can display it on. my screen real time. and we also need proper loading. indicators we need proper error. indicators all of those stuff so let's. go ahead and set it up so to get the. real-time data we need access to an API. and to call an API we will need the HTTP. package we've already seen that in the. dart section. so let's go ahead and install the HTTP. Plugin or package to our flutter code in. dot pad it was available for us but here. in flutter when we are on our local. system we have to install it so we need. to go to pubspect.aml in the. dependencies section we need to add that. dependency. Also let's get the HTTP version now. we have pub.dev packages HTTP where you. can find the HTTP Plugin or a package. then you can just copy it paste it over. here save it and then it will run. flutter pop get command flood up up get. command gets all the dependencies all of. the things that are mentioned over here. we'll see fonts assets everything. and then it refreshes our project. now we'll be able to use the HTTP plugin. in our code so let's go ahead right at. the top and we are going to create our. function over here and that is going to. return a future. and let's call this function get current. weather. we can Define functions in a stateless. widget that's not not allowed you can. definitely do it so let's put async over. and we already know how to put HTTP. calls it's all given over here first. thing is to import it and. to refresh your memory as HTTP is given. you because. we don't want to call just get function. like this which is present in http.dot. file which you can come over here and. see. so we are using HTTP dot get. this makes it easy then it requires. something known as an URI and. to pass a URI you can just do uri.parse. or UI dot https. either of them work but I'm going to go. ahead with uri.pass because I already. have the URL it's going to give me. now if you're wondering what URI is URI. stands for uniform resource identifier. URL stands for uniform resource locator. the difference between URI and URL is. that URL is a subtype of URI URI has a. particular scheme which is followed by. URL as well. but URI is like a bigger set and URL is. a subset of it. so let's go ahead and pass our URL here. and. how do we get our URL. well to get it we have to access the API. and the API we're going to use is given. by open weather map in dot section we. are to use Json placeholder that was. just a dummy and a fake mock API all. right this is the real API it's giving. us real data. so what will be the temperature in. London Mumbai England New York. Etc so how do we get access to its API. well first of all I'd like to mention. that there are multiple websites that. offer apis for weather but I like open. Weather the best because it offers a. free API that everyone can use it also. has a paid version for. advanced stuff but for us. the free API is enough all right. so what you need to do is go ahead click. on sign in then you need to create an. account first so let's go ahead and. create an account my name is I'll enter. my email password repeat password click. on these two things and the captcha and. create an account. and I'll see you after I do these steps. so I'll check my email I'll confirm it. and you see they've sent a verification. email then just click on verify your. email. and this email address has been. successfully confirmed. now what we need to do is wait for. another email open whether team will. send us which will contain our API key. it will contain the URL we can use for. free in our projects so let's wait for. it or if you don't want to wait for it. you can click over here my API keys and. you'll see your API key don't use mine. because I'm just going to deactivate. this after this tutorial kindly use your. own API key and you'll also see over. here that the email has arrived and it. contains my API key. and it says within the next couple of. hours it will be activated and ready to. use if I use it right now there's a. possibility that I won't be able to use. it and it will give me an error however. I can do it later on and I can also. create more API keys on my account page. which we've already seen over here I can. generate more API keys. and. it says to always use the API key in. each API call now you might ask hey why. do we need API key. the Json placeholder didn't have API key. right well it didn't have it because it. was a mocked data it was a dummy data it. doesn't have any real value. but this is real-time data it contains. actual data. of the weather. and. some user. might call this API like a hundred. thousand times a million times by just. using a simple for Loop that means the. API will be called a million times so. that will cost the company. a lot. and the company obviously doesn't want. that. that's why API keys are there so that. they can authenticate you. they know that it's you who are using. and they can put trade limits to how. much. times you can call it for our URL over. here we have I think. 1000 free API calls and after that it. will stop working for us. so let's go ahead copy this URL. put https colon slash slash. put this thing over here. and save it. let's break the this URL down and see. what all it contains first one https. which I had to add then API dot. openweathermap.org slash data 2.5 this. is like their model if you're familiar. with chart GPD. it also is. working on certain models right it is. working on 3.5 model. this is the 2.5 model open weather maps. 2.5 model. the three model is. a subscribe version. I'll show it to you over here if you go. to. open Weather API. you see one call Api 3.0. and it has minute forecast Ali forecast. daily forecast it has a lot more stuff. than a simple API cool then we have. weather because we want the weather. you're just having the path then you. have question mark Q is equal to London. most of the interesting stuff happens. after the question mark where you can. change it because this is what is known. as queries. even if you go to Google after the. question mark you'll see the cool stuff. the stuff you can change so we have. question mark Q as equal to London so. this is basically this place name you. want to get the weather off so we can. take this out and put it in a variable. of our own let's call this London over. here. let's take the city name and put Dollar. City name like this. then we have comma UK it's just telling. London comma UK this is where I want to. get the weather off then we have app ID. and this is our app ID Now app IDs need. to be stored in dot EnV file which can. be hidden by. get ignore and even when you want to. deploy your website but assuming you're. not going to deploy this website let's. put it in a separate file of its own. which you can ignore if you're pushing. to GitHub now if you don't know what. GitHub means don't worry about it just. save it in a different file let's go. ahead and call this. secrets.. and here I'm going to have constant. open whether. API key which is equal to this time. now we'll copy this come over here and. have Dollar open Weather API key also. press command full stop to import the. particular secrets.file. let's see if this much and let's see. what we get let's put a weight here we. already know the protocol let's have. final result is equal to this then we. are going to have print result dot body. because I just want to see what all it. gives me. and now if I restart I see absolutely. nothing why because this function is not. called. we need to call it somewhere right we. can go ahead and call this in build. function but I already told you before. that build function needs to be. kept away from asynchronous stuff. and I've also mentioned the reason. before. build function should always be the. least expensive so you can you should. not call this function in the build. function so what should we do. well we can do one thing we can convert. the stateless widget to a stateful. widget then use the init State method. and then we can call this particular. function over there right that sounds. reasonable. so to create a stateful widget we'll. have to do stf L and create a stateful. widget right not really. the dart and flutter extension is quite. generous with this you can just press. Ctrl shift r. you get the options to change stuff and. you have convert to stateful widget if. you just click on it it will make the. appropriate changes and convert it to a. stateful widget without giving any error. so our stateless widget is Now stateful. widget with just one click and our. method is also defined over here. correctly not inside of the stateful. widget. class it's correctly defined inside of. this class. now let's go ahead and create nth state. the super.net state should always be at. the top. then we have get current weather. save it command J. and you see as soon as we reload it. gives us an error if we restart it will. again give us an error the reason for. this is. 401 error 401 error stands for bad. request. as you already know 404 stands for. page not found so four zero four is. so four zero one is there so that. you see that it's a bad request and a. message is also provided for further. context saying invalid API key please. see this thing for more info. now if I click over here open it. you see API calls return on error 401. and these are the possible things that's. why it gave us an error you did not. specify your API key we did your API key. is not activated yet next couple of. hours it will be activated and ready to. use so this is a problem. rest of the things are fine we are using. the free subscription we are not using. the wrong API key and only we have not. waited for the uh for a couple of hours. so I'll see you after a couple of hours. when our API key is activated and we can. use it so I'm back after three hours and. the data is now coming we have all the. data we require to display it on the. screen so now let's just understand what. is useful for us and what is not so that. we can only include parts that are. useful to us and extract them right so. the first thing that we require is well. I just want to take this and put it in. some form of. visualizer where I can properly see the. data so what I'm going to do is copy. this URL go to Google Chrome paste it. and obviously we need to pass in some. stuff like the city name should be. London the app ID should be present so. let's go ahead and pass in the app ID. which is present in secrets. and when I press enter I see all the. stuff that I require right. now if you see this data this data is. giving me. the weather. the main temperature so I'm getting what. the temperature right now in London is. and I'm getting wind speed and all of. that stuff but I'm not getting the. forecast and that's because we have used. the wrong API. the API we should be using is not data. 2.5 weather because this will give us. the weather I want forecast so I'll just. go ahead and pass in forecast here and. I'll be able to get the forecast of. the weather you see this list has 40. items and if you're wondering how I'm. having this Json in. this format it's because of an extension. and the extension name is Json formatto. all right now you see we have a list. that returns 40 items and in every list. we have an object and in this object or. a map we are getting the temperature. then we are getting the. weather name that we require in our app. over here. then we have the pressure humidity. all of that stuff right so we need to. use the forecast wire and. using this we can extract the data. so what is the data we require well. first of all. I want to check if it's a status code of. 200 or not the status code of 200. basically says that hey this request is. successful. otherwise we get a status code of 401. which was like bad request so yeah first. of all I want to make sure that it's a. correct request. also I want to try it in a. wrap it in a try and catch block so. let's go ahead have try catch block. then we have through e.2 string I've not. talked about throw in the dot section. because I wanted to specifically show it. over here what through does is basically. like if you want to return something. from a function. and suddenly you encounter an error so. you just throw that error you're saying. that this function when it was called. did not give any result it resulted in. an error. and that means your app will crash if it. is not handled. so I'm just throwing the error that hey. I received an error just take it and. display it on the screen or do whatever. you want so we need to correctly handle. this throw all right. otherwise. our app will break. the next thing I want to do here is. first of all check the status code if. it's 200 or not so for this I can do. if response dot status code is equal. equal to 200 this is one way of doing it. the other way of doing it is taking the. status code that they've mentioned over. here. so first of all we'll have to decode the. response dot body because it is in a. string format we already saw that in the. dot section so we have json.json decode. put it in rest dot body save it. and also you see as soon as I import. Json decode dot convert gets imported. now. you can see Json decode required a. string source so we have passed and. response to our body it returns a. dynamic so what I want to do is final. data is equal to Json decode. and after I have the data with me. I can just check if. data at COD that's what it's called. right Cod. is not equal to 200 and I'm putting it. in strings over here because Cod returns. to as a string. right. the alternative to this could be. converting this to an integer. so you could go ahead and do n dot parse. what we have learned before. to convert from string to an integer and. then you can check is not equal to 200. like this both of these things work you. can use whatever B you prefer and that. will work fine all right. so let's go ahead with this part right. here. so if the status code is not 200 that. means some error occurred if some error. occurred then we again want to throw. saying an unexpected error occurred. I hope you're understanding what throw. means I mean of course you won't. understand it right now but when we call. the function. it will basically throw you an exception. saying that hey there is an unhandled. exception. saying that an unexpected error occurred. all right and in the else condition or. you can just have it over here no need. of health condition because through. basically returns from the function it. doesn't execute any further just like. return does all right. so if you put through here. it will terminate the function at this. point it won't go any further. and finally what I'm going to do is. print data. at and the thing I want to print is the. temperature wire so we are going to have. data which gives us this thing. data at least so with list I'll access. this thing so I'll have data at list and. since it's a list I will access the. zeroth element on it to get the first. prediction or the First Data stuff. so here I have it. and I'll do listed 0 then I'm going to. have Main. and after that I'm going to have. temperature. okay. so list at 0 which is the first map then. we have Main and then we are accessing. the temperature so that should give us. let's say 291.8 or something similar. let's go over here let's restart the app. and we do 3290 1.65 so we were. successful in retrieving the correct. stuffs now we just want to display it on. the screen right I want to display it. over here how can I display this thing. over here it's enclosed in a function. right so what I can do is create a. global variable let's call this. double temperature. which is equal to let's say 0 initially. or you might be tempted to use late. double because we are assigning the. value late right so this should work. but let's see if it actually works I'm. going to set temperature equal to this. okay and now I'm going to pass. temperature over here so I'm going to. have dollar temperature k. so it gives me 291.12 Kelvin now I'm. also going to remove constant let's put. the correct constants everywhere. again I'm pressing option to select. multiple cursors and put constant cool. let's come back over here and you see. late initialization error field temp has. not been initialized let's restart it. maybe that works not really this doesn't. work why because. if we come over here we get current. weather. this thing runs before the build. function. and that's cool. but what if I do print. build function or let's call this init. state. then I'm going to print this statement. again over here. function called. then I'm going to print after this API. call all right after this API call I'm. going to I have API ended all right. and finally I'm going to have a print. statement saying build. function called. now let's open. by using command J restart and you see. over here init state. we have in its data where. then we have function called and then we. directly have build function called. so it skipped this part. but earlier we printed this value and it. got printed correctly right then why is. it giving an error right now well that's. because. what you're doing is assigning this to. late late basically means that. you have a contract you need to assign. it before the build function is called. if you're using it obviously in the. build function if you're not using it in. the build function. late doesn't really care. but if you're using it somewhere. it will start to care. so what happens is late double. temperature then you are having in its. state then you have get current weather. this function gets called and this API. call is there now this API call is going. to take time right you're retrieving. some data from the web that will take. time depending on your internet. connection. but while it is waiting we have already. executed the build function because. that's how asynchronous stuff works. it won't wait for it to complete it just. said hey just complete this in the. future. I'll just go ahead and do my stuff so it. called the build function and here when. the build function was called you also. called The Late variable temperature. which hasn't been initialized. that's the problem. so what should we do then. what is the fixed aware well first of. all let's just remove all the print. calls. I don't like seeing warnings that much. unless there are constant warnings. so we are back to normal now so one. possible fix here is having double. temperature is equal to zero as soon as. we do that press command J. restart the app come over here we get. 0.0 Kelvin again the value is not. initialized what is the other case. well that's the case because. you again. set this to zero then you have get. current weather it is getting the data. in the background let's say. and in the meantime it also called the. build function if it called the build. function it already used the value of. temperature given to it which was zero. and later on when the value arrived. the build function was already ready and. displaying it but then you said hey set. temperature equal to this thing over. here so you're reassigning the value. after the build function is called it's. as good as calling a function after. ontap. so my point is you just need to wrap it. with a set state. if you do such State what will happen is. when you restart. you see 0 and then it converts to 291.65. because initially the value is 0 then. it's retrieving the value in the. meantime you'll show the value of 0. over here and then you finally got the. value of temperature. which you have assigned and then you. call such state to rebuild the build. function and that way. you get. 291.65 Kelvin. so I hope that made sense to you if it. did not ask me in the comment section. and I'll explain it to you again but. anyways if we again restart the app this. does not look good it's not a good user. experience to show zero Kelvin first. then show. 291.65 Kelvin. it's just not a good experience so what. I want to show instead is a loading. indicator so as. long as this function is loading and we. are getting a data we are just going to. keep loading the screen. so I'm just going to replace this body. part with a circular progress indicator. instead as long as as it's loading all. right so this all will disappear and. only a loading indicator will show up. so let's go ahead and have a body here. now how do I show a loading indicator. here well the first approach is to use. the temperature and have if temperature. is equal to zero. then we can use. a loading indicator now what is the. widget for loading indicator well it's. just. progress indicator and you can have two. types of progress indicator or three. types. I don't know but you can have leaner. progress indicator refresh progress. indicator circular progress indicator. the one I like the most is circular. progress indicator however go ahead and. try linear progress indicator and. refresh progress indicator for yourself. I'm going to go ahead with circular. progress indicator now I'm also going to. have Constable air the reason I'm doing. temperature is equal equal to 0. is because the temperature can never be. zero Kelvin. if it's zero Kelvin then we are freezing. it's absolute temperature right that's. why if it was some other value I. wouldn't put is equal equal to 0 because. some other temperature can be attained. let's say the initial value was. 270. I wouldn't do. temperature is equal equal to 270. because temperature can be 270 Kelvin. but because temperature can be 270. Kelvin when it is coming from this thing. right here. some place might have a temperature of. 270 Kelvin but no place has a. temperature of. zero Kelvin that's why I'm using it to. display a circular progress indicator. however another option could be to use. another variable called Boolean is. loading which is initially set to false. then you come away you set State you set. is loading to true so you're basically. telling hey rebuild the build function. is loading is now true. then here you have. is loading. set to false. and you come down and you just have. is loading. if it's loading then show circular. progress indicator otherwise the padding. is fine now let's restart. and you see we see a circular progress. indicator in the left hand side and then. this thing. so that means our loading indicator is. working however if you use temperature. is equal equal to 0 as well it will work. just fine. let's restart. you see 270 Kelvin not 270 Kelvin sorry. I'll set it to 0. I'll restart loading indicator is there. and then I see this thing over here. so I hope that made sense to you. now you can use either of those. approaches it is on you but my point. right now is this is quite tedious to be. honest I have to set up my own loading. indicators I have to set up my own error. handlers for example if I just misspell. in something in the API and then I start. to run my function I'll see an error all. right you see unhandle exception format. exception blah blah blah blah. and it continuously keeps loading. because I haven't set up my it's loading. properly in case of an error I have to. set it to false even here. if there's an error I have to set as. loading set to false so I have to do all. of this stuff on my own and it's quite. tedious for me. luckily flutter has something for us. let's look at it. also. you see unhandled exception format. exception all of that. and if we use let's say data 3 over here. and then restart. you'll see unhandled exception and. unexpected error occurred what we had. over here. so basically throw is just returning an. exception for you. and the error message can be whatever. you have written over here so I hope. that made sense to you what this throw. does it basically throws an exception. and whenever you have an unhandled. exception you have to add a try and a. catch block here and do stuff on your. own however. you have to put a try on catch block. here let's have e over here and then you. have get current weather. then whatever error it gives you just. print e all of that stuff you'll have to. do it or just don't throw from here. however my point is there's a lot of. stuff to do a lot of error handling to. do instead. I can use something provided by flutter. which will. boost my performance by a lot so let's. remove energy State let's remove this. loading let's remove the temperature as. well. all the set states are not required. anymore. we can keep this line over here because. we are going to extract the mean. temperature again but not over here. and what we are going to do is just. return data in case of a status code of. 200. now let's come over here let's. remove the loading indicator for now. and here again we're going to go back to. the static value however you already. know. constants are not going to be needed. anymore because we are all going to have. a dynamic value so let's not use. constant because the value is going to. keep changing it's coming from an API. all right and what I'm going to do is. wrap padding widget with. another widget and what is that widget. future. Builder this is a widget provided by. flutter that. eases our life by a lot when dealing. with Futures and if we want to display. something related to our future. so we're going to have a future we are. going to have a builder. then we are going to have context. snapshot I'll explain what snapshot is. and we're going to have an RO function. returned from a builder so these are two. required arguments of future Builder. quite convenient future and Builder now. I'll explain both of these things but. let's resolve the error we have only. future so what is this future build up. well basically you just need to pass in. your future over here it can be anything. future of object and object is a super. class of everything. so you can pass any function over here. any variable that is a future. and it will build according to it so if. I go ahead and return my function which. is a future. so I'm going to have get current weather. and then let's just convert this to a. block all right I don't want an arrow. function because I want to print. something here. I cannot print. function does not allow it it just. allows me to return one thing if I just. convert it to a block I'll be able to. print it so press Ctrl shift R get the. refactoring option and it asks you to. convert to block body. so let's convert it. save it it will format let's go right. over here and we are going to print. snapshot what exactly is this snapshot. also we're going to print the runtime. type of the snapshot. so press command J. we're going to restart. and we see something like async snapshot. Dynamic connection state DOT weighting. async snapshot Dynamic so this is the. runtime type then we have our entire. value coming and A6 snapshot dynamic. so what is this thing over here well. snapshot is basically a class that. allows you to. handle States in your app a loading. state. a data State an error State you can. handle all of that using async snapshot. that's what snapshot gives us. you see over your connection state DOT. waiting why did this connection state. DOT weight income because you were. getting data from the web so it's saying. that hey we are still getting your data. then we have the runtime type because we. printed it and after a while it said. connection state DOT done that hey we. got your data it's successfully there. and. it printed it out to us this null null. null stands for each and everything if. it's if it is having data if it is. having error if it is having loading. what is it having. so that's what null null stands for over. here. so anyways now that we understand this. we can handle the loading State easily. we know whenever there's loading State. we have connection State DOT waiting so. if we have if snapshot Dot. now what do we use snapshot dot hash. data has error connection state. right because this might be an enum or a. class I don't know. and this requires a connection State as. well so I'm just going to have if. snapshots dot connection state is equal. to connection State DOT and it is an. enum and it gives us values like active. done none waiting. when it's loading it is giving us. waiting right so we can just use that. and return. a circular progress indicator Also let's. return a constant over here perfect now. if I restart I see the loading indicator. and 200 Kelvin I again restart I see. loading indicator 200 Kelvin. now 200 Kelvin is not the correct value. it's hard coded but you see we are. getting the loading indicator and then. our data so we don't have to handle all. of the stuff on our own if there's error. we can print it how we can just have if. snapshot dot has error. if snapshot has error then we are going. to return constant text saying snapshot. dot Arrow which is an object all right. and this can't be a constant because. snapshot dot error. is a dynamic value it's coming from. snapshot right it's not a static value. it's not a hard-coded value or a. constant value so we need to return. text Dot to string because text cannot. take an object it has to take in a. string. so we return an error. all right. so if snapshot has zero that means if. the async snapshot has error then we. just want a text to show the error on. the screen. and what return will do is basically. just return this text from here it will. not display anything from here and. that's exactly what we want in case of. error just display it to the user don't. display wrong values that's not how our. app works let's get rid of snapshot. let's save this restart we have a. loading indicator and there's no error. so it doesn't show anything however if I. just take this. not take this if I spell this. incorrectly let's say. data 3. let's restart the app you see loading. indicator and then an unexpected error. occurred that's a good sign. now if you want to return a different. kind of message you can do that you can. have data. message because with every code which is. not 200 we get a message as well when we. had four zero one we had a message as. well you see internal error shows up now. that's what the error says. if here I type in data at. three forecast it says internal error. and the code is 404 are favored not. found. so let's come back to our 2.5 model even. here 2.5 model. I think I'm going to keep an unexpected. error occurred that's a better message. than whatever the API might give us. cool so now we are able to handle the. loading indicator and the error message. now let's style it a little bit because. the loading indicator is showing right. in the left hand side corner so let's. Center it to center it Ctrl shift r. then wrap it with Center you all are. experts in this now you can just pass in. constant. and now a loading indicator will be. centered perfect. I still have some problem with it. if I restart it's showing a material. design. loading indicator on an iOS simulator. what I want to do is show this kind of. icon. or this kind of loading indicator only. on Android devices not on iOS devices. that's why what I'm going to do is use. circular progress indicator dot adaptive. with adaptive. it changes based on. the operating system it's on so if it's. on iOS it gives a iOS kind of indicator. and if we open a pixel it will give us. the material design. progress indicator and that's really. cool it just gives us a native feel. now if you want to use circular progress. indicator you can use it I just wanted. to show this cool thing to you. also this text can be centered so let's. go ahead and wrap it with Center sweet. now. we have handled the loading State we. have handled the error State and finally. we are on the data state so let's go. ahead and retrieve our data for our. first data we have already implemented. the logic for it so let's just copy that. so here we're going to have final data. which is equal to. snapshot.data and this data can be. nullable all right. so we are just going to apply here that. hey the data here is never going to be. nullable also. I've already mentioned this to you. before whenever we return future or. anything like stream future always make. sure that you have a generic type. because future Dynamic isn't cool we've. discussed this in dot course. so what I want to do is return a future. of some type and here I'm going to. return data but what is the data well it. is a map because at the end of the day. we are getting an object of string. so everything over here is a string in. the left hand side all the keys are. strings. but on the right hand side sometimes it. is integer sometimes it is string. so we can just have future of map of. string comma dynamic. so here the dynamic is necessary because. stuff keeps changing on the value side. on the right hand side. cool now if you come over here. you see. snapshot.data has a value of map string. comma Dynamic with a nullable option. first of all future Builder is correctly. able to identify based on the future we. provided over here. and secondly this is nullable why is. this nullable because it thinks that it. might not have an error why does this. have a nullable option because it thinks. that maybe there's an error maybe. there's loading state it cannot. definitely have a value that's why it is. nullable but now since we have handled. the error State and we have handled the. loading state. we are quite sure that it is going to. have a value. otherwise you can just check it on your. own if snapshot dot has data what has. data does behind the scenes is just. check if data is not null it's basically. checking if data is not equal to null. that is what snapshot.house data is and. same goes for has error error is not. equal to null. okay. you can do that but here I'm quite. confident it is going to have data now. I'm going to have final current. weather. temperature. or let's just say current temperature. because we are also having forecast. right if there's forecast there's a. possibility of having. later values as well so that won't be. current temperature. so we're going to final current. temperature and we're going to set it to. data list 0 main temperature which was. our main temperature or the current. temperature that we want to show. and finally we are going to come back. here and type dollar current temperature. Kelvin restart. and with the loading indicator we get. the right value perfect so the first. part of our app is complete congrats to. us. now let's go ahead and change this icon. and this text based on what we get so. this icon over here is based on the text. right if it's sunny I want to show a sun. if it's rain cloud whatever I want to. show. a cloud icon. and for that we have a value in our list. which is weather mean. so what I need to do is. final current. what do we call this. current Sky because it is telling me how. the sky is cloudy whatever. so let's call this current sky. and then we are going to have data at. list at 0. same thing as before data list 0. then we're going to have weather instead. of Main. and then we are going to have the main. cool now we can take this current sky. and paste it over here. so you're going to have. current sky like this and it's going to. be a string all right. because main clouds. this is a string. so save it put it as constant come back. over here. and it gives us an error why because the. type string is not a subtype of type int. of index let's see why we get this error. and the reason for this error. is if you come over here weather is a. list we neglected that. we directly said hey data listed 0. whether. is a list and what we are saying is. called. the main property on a list the list. cannot have a main property. only maps have that only objects have. that so first we need to access this. particular array and after that we can. access main property on it so here we. need to do whether at zero so we iterate. or we grab the first element of the list. and then we call the main method on it. or the main property on it and when you. come over here clouds are seen. perfect. now you see we are repeating stuff over. here data at less zero so what I can do. is shift this in another variable so I. can have final current weather data. is equal to data listed 0. because technically this current. this consists of current weather data. and now I can replace it with this. now this is just an improvement so that. you know you have better readability in. your functions or in your classes or in. your UI code. and you don't have to repeat this stuff. again and again data list 0.. you just store it in a variable and you. can use it anywhere now I'm going to. take this current Sky I'm going to. go down remove constant from icon and. here I'm going to have if current sky is. equal to either cloud. or current sky is equal equal to drain. those are two possibilities all right. and you can put or condition in. a ternary operator. so if it's either of them then we want. to display icons dot Cloud otherwise. icons dot sunny. now if we come back over here we are. seeing. a sun and that's because. the data we are getting is clouds not. Cloud so we need to make sure this is. the correct thing and you know make sure. the case sensitivity is also correct. clouds is not equal to. Capital C clouds all right so make sure. everything is correct you come back over. here and you see clouds perfect so this. part over here is done now let's move to. additional information and after that we. can get to the weather forecast. so in additional information we have. humidity and I've spelled that wrong. even after trying to correct it. let's go ahead and type it over here. now let's get let's get the values of. humidity when speed and pressure let's. explore the API to see if the it has. values and I'm just going to grab this. first. current weather because that should give. me. the wind speed the pressure all of that. stuff I should not be going to the. second element of this list because that. contains the prediction for later on. it's not the prediction as of right now. you see. it has a prediction of some other time. this is the current prediction. so to access pressure we have this thing. over here which is present in main we've. already done this before so let's go. right at the top. we are going to have final. current pressure. you want to type current you can type it. or pressure because you have only one. pressure in our entire app which is the. current pressure. and set that equal to well the current. weather data so you can have. current weather data. so you're act already over here then you. have to access main pressure. so you have Main. pressure. cool now take this mean pressure go down. in additional info item you see this. thing over here. this is this is where you can easily go. from top to the bottom you don't have to. scroll through stuff you can directly. just jump from year to year. and it just saves a lot of time for me. so get used to this and it will save you. a bunch of time. especially in bigger code bases. so we are over here now. the value is going to be 91 but in our. case. not 91 sorry it's not humidity it's. pressure. in our case we need to mention a string. but here it's giving us a number. all right. all the numbers are marked in blue. strings are marked and green. so it's giving us a number so maybe we. can have current pressure dot two string. with two string we are able to only get. the required pressure Also let's remove. constant from here we all know it's not. going to be a constant. let's save it come back over here and. the pressure is one zero one one perfect. the next thing we require is wind speed. how do I get wind speed well it's. present over here in wind speed. so same thing we'll go over here. and Define a variable now obviously you. can copy this and. go down paste it over here and that will. work fine for you there's no problem. with it but when you have variables in. one centralized place in my opinion it. just gets so much easier because if you. want to change anything you can change. all the API related stuff in one place. so let's come back to current wind speed. and that is going to be wind. speed because we are aware data at least. is 0 this thing over here then we are. going to wind then speed and we're. getting the value. we can copy this go down. then I have current wind speed dot two. string again. save it come over here we have 4.45 as. our speed perfect. and the last thing we require is. humidity and humidity is also present in. the same place as our pressure. so let's go to current pressure now if. you press command on our current. pressure variable you'll be able to go. where the current pressure variable is. defined just like we can do with. literally anything right if you want to. go to sized box you can click it over. here and we go to the flutter source. code. if you want to do that in your own. source code you can do that as well so. you go to current pressure now I'm going. to copy this paste it again. and now I'm going to have current. humidity now I know I'm going a bit. faster here and I'm doing that because. this is all the stuff we have covered in. the dot course just knowing what to use. when to use I want to waste much time. over here right so yeah main humidity. we'll take this current humidity and. paste it over here and again pass two. string to it because it's a number. come back over here and our humidity 48. is showing all good. the last thing we want to do is weather. forecast and that too for only five. items you see in our API it gives us a. list of 40 items the first one we've. already used so we are not going to use. it again our numbering is now going to. start from 1.. because 0 was used to display the. current weather now everything from here. is going to display the weather forecast. so let's go to our. weather forecast over here early. forecast item let's call this early. forecast instead of weather forecast all. right that that makes more sense I guess. now how do we handle this. I want to iterate through a list. which is a list. get five elements. and display them on the screen. that's a major after task to do here. do you know how you'll do it. try to do it on your own if you can and. you'll be more confident if you do it. but if you're not then I'll let you know. you can think about using a for Loop all. right when you use a for Loop. let's remove a constant. whenever you use a for Loop. you can go from index one to index five. and display it on the screen. so let's try it what I'm going to do is. for. int I is equal to 1 because I want my. list to start from one I cannot start. from 0 or I can start from zero entire. is equal to 0 I is less than. 5 because I only want five elements I. plus plus. then I'm going to have my Ali forecast. item. I'm going to remove the rest of the. early forecast items. and first of all we require a Time now. where is the time mentioned in our list. it's mentioned over here DT underscore. txt in this format. we'll get to the date format part later. on we only want to get time but it's. giving us date and time both but we'll. get to it later on as of now let's just. display. the entire thing even if we get. the render flow error the error that. shows up in the yellow saying that the. height is extended like we saw over here. with our row when we are not wrapped it. with single child scroll view remember. that. if we remove this widget. you see this error this is render flow. error and we will get that if. we exceed the size already allotted to a. particular widget. so anyways. um. let's get access to the list so it's. going to be data at list. so it's going to be data at least at I. not zero not one not anything but if we. put I we get I is equal to 0 so that. means data at least it's 0 that means. you are getting the same value. instead I'm going to do data at least at. I plus 1 with I plus 1 I get the. starting value as 1 till. 5 including 5 all right so we'll get the. correct stuff. so we'll get elements from 1. or elements one two three four five. that sounds good and once we are over. here let's say we are aware perfect so. first of all I'm just going to print the. date time or the date and you can do two. things for it DT which gives you date. and let's say I think milliseconds since. Epoch now what is Epoch Epoch is January. 1 1970. so how many milliseconds have passed. since January 1 1970 this is what the. daytime is. and in text. this is what it represents third July. 2023 12 am. so you can use either of them I'm going. to go ahead and use DT for now later on. I'm going to use DT text. so that I can format it according to the. way I want and if I come over here we. get type int is not a type of string. because time requires string so let's. convert it to a string and then pass it. in and we have this thing over here and. it keeps changing for everything. we have one six eight eight three four. to four hundred one six eight eight. three five three two hundred all right. so I hope you get the point. then we can have the same thing over. here. data at least I plus 1. main temperature so we're going to have. Main. temp. come over here and it says type double. is not a subtype of type string. basically temperature is giving us a. double value temperature requires year a. string value so call to string again. come back and you see 289.84. 287.855 and all of that stuff looks good. and finally we want to display the. correct icon now to display the current. icon we have already put a logic. and we know how. to evaluate if it's. a good thing or not. so what we need to do is. go at the top have current Sky scroll. back. and we're just going to have if current. be the weather data instead of current. weather data I'm going to have data at. least at I plus 1 right because current. weather data is data at least at zero. instead of having zero here I'm having I. plus one I hope you're following along. so you have data at least I plus 1. then main then temperature main. temperature. not mean temperature sorry. I plus 1 whether. 0 mean and if that is equal to clouds or. if that exact thing is equal to. rain then we are going to have icons dot. Cloud otherwise I can start Sunny then. we save it. become aware and you see when we add. a sunny weather we had. Sunny icon showing up. now if we come back over here just to. verify we are going to go over here. we'll see. that the main over here is clear and in. clear we want to show Cloud no sun we. don't want to show clouds clouds is only. there for rain and stuff. okay so yeah we have been able to build. the app. the problem here is what if. instead of showing five things I want to. show 40 things. exactly how much. this allows. or 39 because. or let's say 38. and let's say I want to return or have. less than 39 items here. then what will happen well if I restart. you see we get a bunch of our icons. those are all good. but what's Happening Here is they are. not building on demand they are all. building together now we are getting our. weather forecast and that all is correct. that's all good that's perfect but the. problem here isn't about displaying and. getting the correct data it's about a. performance of the app all the widgets. here are building together that's a big. problem when we are returning like 40. widgets together right because it's like. 40 widgets are building together isn't. that just insane. it will affect the performance of the. app very much. so instead of building 40 widgets. together at the same time what I want to. do is build this widget. just when we scroll all right. so it lazily creates our widgets only. the part that is scrolled will get. created otherwise it won't get created. so it won't affect the performance of. our app. I hope you understood this if not I'll. repeat you can skip if you understood. what I'm saying is 40 widgets are being. created together now that is a Major. Performance thing because just imagine. like 40 components on the screen. together at the same time that's just. making sure that your app performs less. well. so what I want to do is Implement kind. of like lazy loading where the widgets. are being lazily loaded. not the data we get the data as it is. but the widgets are being created on. demand as and when I scroll all right so. like if I scroll like this the widget. should get created not all at once. so. for this I'm just going to go ahead and. comment out the entire single child. scroll View. and I'm going to create my own early. forecast from scratch using a widget. which is very very important. and that is called list view Builder. see this thing over here list view. Builder there's another widget called. list view which we haven't talked about. and list view is basically like you know. if you want a column that is scrollable. and you want to. mention padding from the side you can go. ahead and list use list View. it will help you over there. we are probably going to use list View. later on in a third app. but. as of right now we're going to use list. view dot Builder. it requires a named argument of item. Builder and it gives us context and. index. also one thing I think I forgot to. mention is whenever you have for Loop if. conditions inside of flutter code you. don't have to mention brackets. I'm so sorry I forgot to mention this. brackets are not required when you have. flutter code. you can just mention for Loop no need of. bracket and if you want to return more. than just. One widget you can have dot dot dot and. a list. okay. so what you're basically doing is. wrapping all of them in a list. and then you're destructuring the list. so that everything shows up. for all the 40 Widgets or 39 widgets all. right. so let's remove it we only want to. have one widget for Loop. that's why I'm just going to keep it. like this also let's comment it out. again. and let's focus on our list view Builder. now listview Builder will build on. demand it accepts item Builder which. requires a widget to be returned which. is nullable and it gives us build. context. again and an index now this index is. there because. you need to mention something known as. an item count so this list view Builder. is basically telling hey we'll help you. to build a list of items. that are lazily loaded so it will get. loaded as and when you scroll. but you need to mention the item count. how many items there are and the item. Builder so what do you want to build. and for that we are giving you the index. because obviously if you mention the. item count let's say the item count is. five I am giving it a static value. here we are not going to know what to. return for example I'll return Ali car. forecast item but then I have to mention. time temperature icon. now how do I get access to time here we. had I I Plus 1. this is how I would know. I'm accessing one particular element. from the list how can I do it over here. that's why index is present. just like there are four Loops I. this is the index that will help us. so let's go ahead get the data so we are. going to have. our data Final early forecast. which is equal to data at least index. plus one again we are going to have plus. one because list view Builder also. starts from zero. so we have our early forecast now the. first thing that I want to return here. is DT which is the time so let's go. ahead and have DT dot to string which is. just time in two string then we have. temperature so we are going to have. early forecast. then main then. temp and Dot to string and finally we. are going to have our icons I'm just. going to copy this line I'm not going to. type it again. and paste it over here. Also let's uncomment this so to. uncomment it I'm going to press command. slash. and there we go. and finally I'm just going to take all. of this out in one thing. which is final. early Sky let's call it that. then we're going to have index plus 1. and then. if Ali sky is equal to clouds or early. sky is equal to rain. then we are going to show the cloud. otherwise sunny. now you can shift all of these variables. outside as well so you're going to have. final early temperature which is equal. to this thing. let's paste it over here then we are. going to have our date time which needs. further factoring but as of right now. our list view Builder is complete what. we are saying is build five items and. this is what you need to build build Ali. forecast items five times and it will. only be visible as and when we scroll. press command J and we are received by. errors and a UI that doesn't look quite. good. let's restart. and still the UI is still dismantle I. don't know how it's looking like this. and we're getting a lot of Errors over. here. now I'll simply tell you the reason you. can go ahead and read the errors. but I'll tell you a simple reason for. this. list view Builder has a tendency of. taking the entire screen size. like you know our text field also has. the tendency of taking the entire width. of the screen even less view Builder has. a tendency to take the entire screen. and here. we cannot give it the entire screen. obviously because we have this thing. over here then we have our additional. information down below. so we have to restrict the height. to restrict the height we press Ctrl. shift R wrap it with the sized box and. give it a height of 120.. if we do that we are restricting the. height to one particular thing you see. and now we have our list which is. scrollable and it only has a height of. 120.. but still I want it to be like this like. we had before in the horizontal. Direction. we have a nice property for that in list. view Builder which is scroll Direction. just like we had in a single child. scroll view so we are going to pass in. scroll Direction access dot horizontal. save it and when you come over here we. have met with an arrow and this error is. solely there because we have set. the list view Builder's height so this. list view Builder entire thing its. height is 120. and it is exceeding the. current height. which is why we are getting this error. and it's only there because this thing. this text is going down below that's not. good. so what we can do is restrict the text. to only be there in one single line so. if we go to our Ali forecast item widget. scroll down we have our text of time the. text has a property of Max lines if. you'll see. here we can tell how many lines a text. can take maximum and it can only take. maximum of one line and you see the. error is resolved however it Clips. things off and there is no notification. about it like hey we clip this off. there's absolutely nothing told about it. so we need to change that so for that. text and has another property which is. Overflow. so whenever it overflows it will just. have a certain style attached to it so. we have text. overflow Dot and it has clip let's see. what clip looks like. the same thing as we had before dot. Ellipsis so this will give us dot dot. dot which tells hey this is extending. then we have text overflow dot fade so. it will just fade in telling you hey we. are. cutting it off. and then we have finally. visible which is just completely visible. I like Ellipsis more because it just. tells you that hey there's more to it. but we have dots over here. anyways now that we have our stuff good. our Ali focus is showing our app is now. working based on our weather API. we're almost done only difference. is the time that we want to show. I told you we are not going to show DT. we are going to show DT underscore text. which is not what it says it's DT. underscore txt not t EXT and we come. away and we see 2023 all of that stuff. now what I want to do is. of the entire date given I only want to. access this particular thing only the. line. so. think how will you be able to do it. one possible suggestion would be. to go ahead and use substring and I. totally agree you can go ahead and use. substring because it is in the format of. yyy. hyphen. mm hyphen DD. so it is going to have a particular set. of characters after which you can. extract your time and that works fine. for me. and maybe you want to use that but I'm. going to take another approach which is. to add a package to our app for this. and what is the package well if you go. to pub.dev and type intl Intel. you'll see this package and this package. is published by dot team themselves. saying they provide internationalization. and localization facilities including. message translation and whatnot. but if you scroll down. they also help with number formatting. they also help fit date formatting and. passing which is exactly what we need. we have a date in a particular format. and we only want to display the time. based on that. so we can go ahead and add Intel to our. pubspect.aml file now instead of going. at the top copying Intel going to. perspect.aml file scrolling down. and in the dependencies adding Intel. like this there's another thing you can. do. nvs code press command shift p. then you have the property of adding dot. add dependency when you search for it. you'll see this and here you can just. pass in the package name Intel and it. will automatically add it to public.aml. for you run flood up object runs. everything. and you see Intel is automatically added. for us so you can use this when you want. to add packages in Bunch for example I. want to add let's say Intel I want to. add HTTP I want to add multiple things I. can separate them by comma and add. everything. but since I've already added I'm going. to press escape to escape that dialog. sweet. so now that I have access to. date formatting. let's go ahead and use it now you can. refer to the documentation that was. mentioned earlier but since I've used it. before date format dot dot pass. I don't need reference to it but. obviously if you're using it for the. first time highly recommend to read the. documentation that is attached over here. it will help you to use the package. efficiently and properly. so the first thing I want to do is take. this and convert it to a date time. object now you remember in our DOT code. I had introduced you to date time dot. now like this. to demonstrate to you what final. variables were right final time is equal. to date time dot now. well exactly we are going to convert it. to date time. the string so the string is going to get. converted to date time which we can pass. using Intel package. so we're going to have date time dot. pass and whenever you have anything date. related I always recommend to use date. time in Florida because it makes your. job so much easier. especially when using it with the Intel. it will make a lot of stuff easier. for example if you're building WhatsApp. and you know on your home screen or in. your chat screen also in the chat bubble. you see the text of the date as. mentioned or the time is mentioned. how's that possible. how can we do that in flutter well. exactly you can do it over here. so let's go ahead first of all and. convert it to date time so we have date. time dot pass and we need to pass in a. string so we have early forecast. DT underscore text and then. we are going to use date format which is. given to us by Intel package make sure. it's imported right at the top intel.dot. so we are going to update format Dot. and we have multiple stuff over here. every month abbr month day and all of. that stuff. but here even down we have functions for. this. this is basically describing how you. want to. format your date time object. in my case what I want to do is display. it in a format like 0 0 or 3 or 6 or 9. or 12 or 15 or 18 like that so for me I. can just use wire. so for me I can just use date format.hm. and then if I go to hm it basically just. has hm provided to it. hm is basically R followed by minute. which will give me in the format I want. are minute right. so we have date format.hm dot format and. then I'll pass time to it and format. requires a date time which is why I. converted this string to a date time. object. all right now if I do this. come back to the app I have 12 3 6 9 and. 12 showing up. now you can go ahead and try a bunch of. variations here like HMS and you'll see. our minutes second. then you'll have. J let's say and you can try a bunch of. things J is basically 12 am 3 AM 6 AM 9. A.M 12 p.m whatever you prefer you can. use that and that will work for you or. if you want your custom made you can. just update format and you can mention. your own pattern here so if I mention hm. your it will again come back to me like. this. or if I mention J like this. it will let me know like this so that's. the point. these functions were basically doing. that behind the scenes when you add dot. j it was basically calling. J over here. so it was calling date format. at J what is this this refers to the. class itself this date format so you. were mentioning the pattern itself. so you had date format J dot format and. there we go. now we can save it. restart the app and I'm going to go. ahead with 12 am 3 am I like this better. and there we go. so app is looking good now the last. feature that I want is whenever I click. on this refresh icon it should refresh. and if there's any update it should let. the user know. because obviously this is real time only. when we call it it's not like a stream. that will continuously Give us new. updates and new values when I click on. refresh it will refresh the screen. so how do I make sure this refresh. happens Also let's remove the comment. from here I hope you understand why we. want to use less view Builder. it is a better approach overall lazy. loading and all of that stuff. now if become aware in our icon button. what if I just put such date. if I put set State what will happen is. when I refresh. it will rebuild the entire scaffold so. that means it will rebuild this entire. future Builder as well it will call the. get current weather function as well. that means this entire build function is. going to get rebuilt. however. if you check out the flutter official. video on future Builder now what they've. done and recommended to do is store this. in a variable. so you'll have final. weather which is equal to get current. weather. or maybe something like this so you have. laid. future map string comma dynamic. weather then you have NH state. and once we add in its state we are just. going to set a late variable whether. equal to. get current weather all right now I can. use this weather over here instead of. weather all right and now you see. the app loads now you might say hey why. is this not lazy loading and that's. because. this is having the type of future we are. not resolving the future we are not. using a weighted await anywhere if. you're not using a weight anywhere we. are just saying hey call this function. store the future inside of this variable. and then we are calling this variable. and when I restart it doesn't give me. the error. now when I restart or refresh this. doesn't work anymore why. because we are not calling the function. anymore we're calling the variable and. when we call the variable it is not. rebuilding again you see so earlier we. had a function and whenever the build. build function would rebuild this. function would get called. and that is why such State worked. earlier when such state was called. entire build function was rebuilt so. future Builder was also rebuilt so this. future was called the function was. called and when it is called this thing. re-ran and thus we got new values which. were then updated. however here. we've already called the function over. here. okay and the value is present inside of. weather. and we are just passing the weather. variable here so when such state is. called build function is rebuilt this. weather variable is already there with. the value assigned to it by. the function that was called over here. so the function is not getting called. again because such State doesn't call in. its state again it just calls the. weather variable and whether variable. has the type of future map string. Dynamic and future Builder is just. resolving that future giving us a. snapshot so that we can use the data. error loading and display it on the. screen. that's the job of future Builder but. since there was no function function was. not called it was a variable and. variable already has a value assigned to. it it has a value of future map string. Dynamic assigned to it. that's why it is not getting rebuilt the. function is not getting called again. and thus it is not restarting and. flutter always says to use. it like this but in our case. we can call get current weather because. we want it to work that way whenever the. build function is called it should. rebuild or what you can do is. re-initialize weather. to get current weather. so if we search State whether is equal. to get current weather that means we are. re-initializing whether. so if we restart we come over here it. will again rebuild for the entire thing. so as of now in a simple app there's no. difference between. this thing over here or just calling get. current weather and not having this it's. the same thing. but in a bigger app when we get into. inherited widget which is in our third. app itself. and when we talk about State Management. you'll see this build function will get. called even when. such state is not called. because that's the talk about State. Management even such state is a kind of. state of management now I hope your. understanding what state management is. you know what status and we just have to. manage the state so such state is also. type of State Management but it is. related to one single screen just like. scaffold you know. scaffold is there for one single page. set state is there for one single. stateful widget it cannot manage the. state in. two to three different screens. such state will only rebuild one. particular screen it won't go ahead and. rebuild a totally unrelated screen if. some data changes. that's where. things like inherited widget and we're. going to study about riverpod comes in. place. this is just a local State Management. solution. and the State Management we are going to. talk about is global State Management. but we'll get to it I hope you. understood that this is local state. management but yeah we are going to dive. deep into it because State Management is. a very important concept. but anyways you can use whatever I'm. going to go ahead with the weather. option because if you want to expand on. the app's functionalities. and I hope you'll do that after you gain. the knowledge of State Management as. well and incorporate State Management. that we learn in the third app over here. this will be more beneficial all right. so now let's get. to the main.dot file again. and here we have seen our app in dark. mode Let's go ahead and use theme data. dot light. if you use that let's see our app looks. and this looks quite good. I'm not disappointed with the results. we have our card we have everything. showing up nicely. let's switch back to theme data.dog and. this looks nice if I use remove use. material 3 to true. you see this looks quite bad in my. opinion the layout looks good the. coloring is not fine you know all the. borders now have. rectangular or pointy edges I don't like. that and if we just have dot light. light doesn't look that bad I am always. fond of this color the blue color but. still it's not as good as compared to. material 3. all right. so that was the difference I wanted to. show you first Theory I want to talk. about is the layout Theory we've already. seen the Practical usage of this layout. but. since we've already got a practical. experience I want to give you a. theoretical experience with it and after. that we are going to talk about widget. Tree Elementary and render objects thing. that I teased about when we were. starting with flutter. and we're going to talk about what. exactly a widget is. okay. but before that let's talk about layout. in theory the biggest quote in flutter. in terms of layout is constraints go. down sizes go up parent search position. what does this mean let's go over it one. by one the first sentence I said was. constraints go down what does this mean. it means that in flutter widgets receive. constraints from their parent widgets. constraints basically means boundaries. so widgets receive their boundaries from. their parent widgets these boundaries. Define the limits within which a widget. can render itself. each widget passes these constraints or. boundaries down to its child widgets. we've already seen a practical. experience of it with our list view. Builder and a lot more things. if we had our. list view Builder it was taking the. entire screen size. what I said over here is wrap it with a. size box give it a height of 120 so that. means constraints go down. the parent widget size box imposed a. restriction a constrained a boundary on. list view Builder. to take only this much height or this. much space unless you build it the same. it gave its child widgets early forecast. item that particular constraints to. strain. since it couldn't stay it gave us a. render flow error in the bottom you. remember when the time we had DT over. here instead of. DT underscore txt. so list view Builder passed it down to. its children or child. so that is what constraints go down mean. second thing is sizes go up. this means when a widget receives. constraints from its parent it. calculates its own size based on those. constraints. the widget tries to expand to fill the. available space while respect. ing. while respecting any limitations imposed. by the constraints this process occurs. recursively up the widget tree where. each widget determines its size based on. its children sizes. and the constraints received from its. parent this thing is basically what I. have just explained to you early. forecast item took as much height as. much width as listview Builder and size. box restricted on it. since there was five right term counts. it took this much space. since there was access dot horizontal it. took this much space however when I put. access dot vertical it takes the entire. screen size and it implements a. scrolling view like this. all right so I hope you understood what. I meant over here. and the last thing here is parent sets. position. so after determining the sizes of his. children. the parent widget decides where to. position each child Vision within its. layout. the parent widget is responsible for. arranging its children according to its. own layout rules and constraints this is. what we did with the column right. I said we could wrap everything with. align widget we could wrap this text. with a line this text with a line this. text with the line this thing with a. line and that would work but what I did. instead is in the column set cross. access alignment. so that set the position for its. children and its children were. everything that you can see. all of these things are children of. column. so parent widget was responsible for. arranging the children according to. their own layout rules and constraints. so I hope you understood this. this is a theoretical aspect. of it. the Practical I've already shown it to. you and we've implemented it in UI. now you don't have to necessarily. remember it unless you're going for. interviews and stuff. but otherwise if you're just building. for yourself practical experience should. be enough. so now. we are done with the application. completely and I've also talked about. layout let's get into some more. theoretical Concepts which are quite. interesting in my opinion so let's dive. into them now let's understand how. flutter Works behind the scenes to. display something on the UI or to. display something on the screen so to. understand this first we must know that. flutter doesn't really translate any of. the widgets into. particular native uis all right so if. you have a button. flutter isn't going to say hey you're an. iOS platform let's convert this to an. iOS native button if you're an Android. product isn't going to say hey you're on. Android I'm going to convert it to. Android native platform and then display. it on the screen no. flutter doesn't translate to native code. what flutter does is paint something on. the canvas using. its own rendering back end or rendering. system. the rendering system it uses behind the. scenes is this Kia Graphics engine which. is currently being replaced by. impeller. that's why if you come over here when. you run your app and press command J. you'll see. using the impeller rendering backend. because on iOS the work for. transitioning from this Kia Graphics. engine to impeller Graphics engine is. done on the Android it's still being. working on. and they'll cover it soon. but for iOS it is done the shift was. made from skiato impeller because skia. had some. issues with animation and. 3D stuff with impeller. things will be better. but anyways. flutter doesn't translate to Native UI. that's why if you see over here I can. have an Android E look on iOS. right. so this allows us to create customizable. UI and we can have one UI in all our. platforms irrespective of whether it is. on. Android iOS Mac OS web. Windows wherever. so now let's understand how stuff works. so first of all we have our widget tree. the first thing that we have is the. widget tree and we already know what. widget tree is right so let's get it. here type in widget. tree and we know what widget tree is we. have already created our own widget tree. here we have my app material app weather. screen and in weather screen we have. scaffold app bar. icon button future Builder progress. indicator if there has to be one. a text widget if there has to be one and. all of that stuff if you want to take a. look at the overall widget tree you can. click on this search kind of Icon over. here. and this dialog will only show when. you're running your app so this. Dev tools widget inspector page will. only be there only when you run your app. all right and now you see widget tree so. this tells you your entire widget tree. you can just push this down to see the. entire thing so you have root my app. material app where the screen scaffold. everything displaying. and if you open this up a little bit you. have layout Explorer so you have to. select one widget and you'll get a. layout Explorer for that particular. thing so this is how your entire UI. looks like. screen. a scaffold which takes a width of 430. a height of 932. then you have future Builder which takes. a width of 430 then it has a height of 8. something. then you have padding which takes. some constraints and that's what the. layout Explorer is all about you can. explore your layout how your layout. stuff is done then you have widget. details tree. where you can see the properties that. you've used for every single widget be. it padding column whatever. one cool thing you'll notice over here. is something known as render object. and that's what our second or the third. tree is all about so we have one more. tree here so let's paste it. and let's call this render. object. tree all right so what is this render. object tree we all know what widget tree. is Right widget tree will represent the. structure of our UI and it is composed. of multiple widgets but what exactly is. a widget. we know it is the block displaying it on. the screen but what is it. well a widget is just a configuration it. is a lightweight object with final. properties. via the properties final because widget. is immutable right and we've already. seen that whatever is immutable its. state cannot change its properties or. data cannot change. that means widget tree is a very. lightweight object that has only final. properties. to understand. why widgets are immutable. we'll have to understand that widget. tree doesn't really display anything on. the screen it is just there for you to. compose your UI to tell flutter how your. UI should look like flutter will manage. all the rendering stuff behind the. scenes you'll just tell how you want. your stuff and it will do that behind. the scenes. so widget doesn't actually render. anything let's just Chuck the widget. tree and just focus on widget so let's. close the widget inspector and we are. going to just focus on one widget and. understand it for all the widgets. and we are going to focus on the text. widget so text extends the stateless. widget right just like any other widget. it either extends stateless or stateful. widget. so what exactly does text return over. here. the text returns something known as Rich. text if you scroll down you'll find the. build function. you'll find default textile all of those. stuff if conditions then you have widget. result is equal to Rich text. then you again have if conditions and. then you return result. so when there are no external properties. like semantics label or registrar setup. in your app. what you return is a rich text so it is. safe to assume that in normal conditions. like us. Rich Text is being written Now Rich Text. is also a widget and I told you that. widgets are just lightweight object. properties and they don't render. anything so why are we returning a rich. text well if we press command and go to. Rich Text source code you'll see which. text doesn't really extend stateless or. stateful widget. what it does extend is multi-child. render object widget. and multi-child render object widget is. a widget to prove that you'll have to go. into the source code see that it extends. to render object widget go into the. source code and finally you'll see it. extends a widget all right. so rich text is a widget but it doesn't. extend stateless or stateful it. extends multi-child render object widget. and that is what our tree is all about. render object 3.. now render objects are of three types. or render object widget is of three. types you can see it over here. the first type if you scroll down is. leaf render object widget this is used. for widgets that don't have any child or. children. then you have single child render object. widget. this is there for widgets that only have. one child like colored box. an example of leaf render object widget. is error. widget. it doesn't have a child at all it just. displays itself. an example of single child render object. widget is colored box and then we have. multi-child render object widget which. is a column because it has multiple. children right. so that is what render object widget. does the. thing that actually displays stuff on. the screen or renders stuff on the. screen is render object what render. object does is it determines the size. position and visual representation of. the widgets that we created or we have. and they handle tasks such as layout. calculation painting pixels on the. screen. so render object is the thing that. actually displays stuff on the screen. and does that by calling methods like. create render object and update render. object so if you just go to the render. object widget it is an abstract class. right it has create render object and it. has update render object. so this is how it creates and updates. stuff on the screen. so from what we have learned how stuff. happens is widget tree is there every. element of the widget tree is traversed. or it is iterated through or it has gone. through. and then a particular render object. widget for it is created so. it is safe to say that widget tree will. tell render object tree to create. something right. and that's partially true but what if we. call stuff like such date. now if I unnecessarily call such state. in my app what will happen. let's say here I'm not calling weather. at all I just do such date I restart and. when I click on refresh nothing really. happens the widget reads the same. nothing additional gets printed on why. is that the case that's the case because. there is one more tree in the middle. which handles all of these things which. is the brain of whether render object. tree should rebuild or not and that is. the element tree. so let's go ahead and create type and. element tree. so this Elementary is a reflection of. widget tree and is responsible for. managing the life cycle of widgets. elements are created during the mount. phase where they. encapsulate the corresponding widgets. and store mutable state. so basically widget tree goes and. creates a particular element for it. and to understand this again let's dive. in the source code let's go to text dot. dot where our Rich text was. and actually let's just exit both of. them and I'm just going to go in the. definition of. stateless widget so let's go over there. because it's easier to understand there. you see you have stateless widget and. then an override of stateless element. create element stateless element so. every widget that is there if you go to. the widgets definition you'll find here. a method which is create element. so every widget that is there will. create an element for itself stateless. widget will go ahead and create. stateless element. stateful widget will go ahead and create. stateful element so every widget will. create an element for itself and this. Elementary is does a reflection of the. widget tree so here if you have a. stateless widget you're going to have a. stateless element. now if I created my app over here I've. basically created my app element. I'm going to prove it to you by the time. this section of. how flutter displaced UI Ends by the end. of this. chapter I'll be able to explain why I'm. saying my app element is going to be. created. but for now take my word on it. every widget will create an element. which will be a reflection of itself. right and they're only created when you. first start the app during the mount. phase so when you restart. you know this is where elements are. created. and now Elementary is going to take care. of whether render object needs to create. stuff or it needs to update stuff so. whenever you make changes to the widget. tree flutter performs a process called. reconciliation or diffing to identify. the differences between the new and the. old trees and this process is quite easy. because widgets are immutable. since magic widgets are immutable all of. its properties are final and since the. properties are final. it's easier to compare the old widget. tree and the new widget tree. and this reconciliation process is done. so that widget tree doesn't continuously. just keep on creating render object. widgets if it does that it will be a lot. of performance waste you know. so we need to boost the performance we. need to make performant apps for that. the flutter framework needs to be. performed and this is how flutter. framework is performed by performing a. process of reconciliation or diffing. so it identifies the differences between. the new and the old trees and whatever. differences are there only those things. get updated or rebuilt for example let's. say my text changes when I have my. 288.77 Kelvin over here and I restart. let's say this thing over here gets. updated. and let's say this text changes over. here to. 89.0 Kelvin so the render object is not. going to build every other widget it's. just going to build the text or the rich. text again. this way our entire UI is not being. rebuilt or let's say our entire UI is. not being repainted again and because of. this. we are getting performant apps. to give you proof of this I'm just going. to go to the. stateless widget again. here I have stateless element right. I'm going to go in there we have. component element and that finally. extends the element so I have element. over here. and you'll see down in the element that. we have a function. called as update child and here it. checks if new widget is null or and if. the child is not null then it will. deactivate the child and then it checks. if the child is not null then it will. perform some some task so basically this. function update child function is the. thing that will perform the. reconciliation phase. after reconciliation flutter will. perform the layout phase where each. render object will calculate the size. and position of the associated widgets. and then render object will paint. everything on the screen. so now I hope you understand why we need. the elementary elementary is an. intermediary between the widget and the. render object trees that allows flutter. to achieve efficient updates without. recreating the entire UI it will just. recreate one particular UI element or. one particular. object and. and Elementary is the reason why we have. features like hot reloading where you. can modify the widget tree and see. instant updates in the running app for. example if I you know change. this to. theme data dot light save it instant. update happens and everything is now. themedata dot light and if I again. change it everything is instantly theme. data.doc. this Elementary allows it because. stuff to update is so less. that you can instantly do it and you can. do it in the running app now hot. reloading is a big feature because. you don't have to restart your app when. you restart your app the entire thing. rebuilds and because of that. you might lose some very much needed. existing data for example let's say you. were filling a login form and then you. press enter and some error occurs you. fix that error and then when you restart. all of your credentials are gone your. email password everything that you had. entered is gone. now you have to refill those again this. is this is why hot reloading is a much. needed feature because it saves so much. time. so to summarize the widget tree defines. the UI structure Elementary will manage. the widget life cycle and mutable State. and render object will handle the layout. and painting the elementary will act as. a bridge between the widget tree and the. render object by performing the. reconciliation process which will. optimize the updates that need to be. made. now since we've understand what elements. are we need to understand what build. context is now if you come to the build. context source code you'll see abstract. class build context. it has a widget it has owner it has. mounted all of its properties. but if you also go to stateless widget. stateless element component element and. finally to element you'll see abstract. class element. extends something but it implements. build context so basically element is. build context or build context is an. element. and it makes sense right because. build context helps us to locate a. widget in the widget tree and what is. the limit. element is acting as an intermediary. between widget tree and Elementary and. render objectory and every widget. creates an element for itself so it. exactly knows the state of the widget so. it also knows where in the widget tree. or where in the elementary that. particular widget is. and build context also knows that so. build context is actually. an element both of them help us to. locate a particular widget in the widget. tree. they will help us compare the state of. the widget and see if it needs a rebate. and that's why many of the properties on. build context is similar to what an. element might have. for example if you print context Dot. mounted this is a property of element. widget that's a property of element. and if you type in element you won't see. create element method on it. because build context is an element. you get all of these types. and these help us to find particular. things. in the elementary now to prove to you. that an element is created a way of what. I'm going to do also to prove that build. context is an element I'm going to print. context dot runtime type so this will. tell me the type of build context when I. press command J You'll see the runtime. type of build context is stateless. element now if I take the same thing and. go to. weather screen let's scroll down and. paste it over here we'll have a stateful. element so build context is indeed an. element. and that's a very neat way to handle. stuff. because now they're giving you the. element to access stuff and if you have. any. thoughts about what the build context. runtime type it will be the particular. element it is in so it can be stateful. element stateless element. so I hope you understood stuff what we. have covered here is the three trees. widget Tree Elementary and render object. tree render object is the thing that. looks after everything. related to painting Elementary is a. mediary which will handle if the render. object needs to be repaint stuff and. widget tree is what we mention over here. it's just a simple configuration. it is a lightweight object with final. properties and it is immutable because. it's so easy and it's so cheap to create. them and to throw them away. because the element is a manager that. will control everything. and element can also handle and control. the widget's location in the tree. because even build context can do that. we have we've already seen it it also. handles the life cycle of the widget. updating of the render objects and. everything. so. Elementary is a big pillar in the flood. of framework. and we are given access to the element. in the form of build context so we have. understood what build context is. programmatically and the three types of. trees so this is the shopping app we are. going to build with flutter we have. going to have four products displayed. over here. with their title price and the image we. also have a custom font for every thing. then when we click on a particular. product we get directed to a product. details screen where we again see the. title The Shoe image the price and the. sizes to select from if we don't select. a size we get a pop-up From Below saying. that we need to select a size. then once we select the size we can add. to cart and the product will be added to. our card successfully then we can go. back come to a cart and we'll see that. particular shoe in a card. I can also add more products here let's. say I add Jordans let's say I add 10. I'll add to card come back and I see. Jordan shoes over here now I can also. delete a product from a cart let's say I. want to delete this men's Nike shoes. I'll click on delete I get this. confirmation dialog. I can either click no or I can click on. yes and that will remove the product. from the cart. so this is the app we're going to build. and we're going to learn a ton about. theming navigation and State Management. so let's dive right into it the first. thing that's required is a flutter. project so we are going to go to the. desktop where I'm going to create my. flutter project and run the command. flutter create let's call it shop. underscore app underscore flutter. okay. I already have shop underscore app. created in the desktop which is why I've. named the shop app flutter then I'm. going to go to the shop app flutter open. it in vs code. and then obvious code open I'll close. this for now I'll go to lib main Dot. and we have our normal file okay I'm. also going to run it on the iOS. simulator so that. we know that the project is working well. and we can confirm it in the meantime. I'm going to set up my screen over here. so for our own reference I have taken a. screenshot of the simulator and put it. here side by side so that we can have. the app and the US side by side cool so. we need to make this screen like this. thing over here. so let's clone it so first of all we'll. have to remove the counter app but one. thing I want you to note is this color. scheme Line This is color scheme color. scheme Dot from seed seed Color colors.d. Purple okay and also remember the screen. because I'm going to reference this. later on. when we add theming to our own. application now let's get done with it. let's remove it then I'm going to create. the stateless widget call it my app then. I'm going to return a material app. where the title is going to be shopping. app. and the. whom is going to be. a different widget so I'll have to. create a different widget I'll go to the. lib folder create home underscore page. dot dot this is all the boilerplate. stuff I hope you are understanding it so. I'll have to import material.dot again. then we'll have a stateless widget which. will be called home page and we want to. return a scaffold. so that an empty screen appears that's. it. I only want to see an empty screen as of. now we'll take it step by step. so we have home page returned over here. that is nice. and now if I come over here our counter. app is now replaced by a blank home page. so we have the boilerplate stuff ready. now the next thing I want to do is just. start designing the app but when we. start designing the app you'll realize. that this font is a bit different. and the font we generally use in Android. iOS it's different from what is present. over here why let's just take an example. of the weather app we created. you see this weather app. the font aware is quite different from. the font mentioned over here so what we. need to do is. add our own custom fonts to the app. so there are two ways to do it first way. is to use a package called Google. underscore fonts this is provided by. material.io. which is the Google team themselves and. we have it working on all the platforms. Android iOS Linux Mac OS web windows. so what this does is basically a package. to use fonts from fonts.google.com and. fonts.google.com is like a registry of. all the fonts that you can use freely in. your apps. you see it has a ton of. fonts you can use. and you can use whatever one you want. but the one I'm interested in using is. lato so this is the style I'll be using. and this is a style which is used over. here as well. now you can explore and find your own. font but I'm going to go ahead with. later. now you can use this font. to easily add later to your app. all you need to do is mention a text. widget. then you have this text you'll mention. the style then you'll use Google fonts. which is provided by this Google fonts. package that we'll add to our app dot. later so when you call this later method. on Google fonts. you'll be able to add the later. font. to your app and your app will start. looking different that's all that you. need to do. so this package has its own pros and. cons the pro over here is it can be used. in production to reduce the app size. because you don't have to install the. font to your. app you don't have to install it on your. system either all you need to do is just. use this and. Google fonts package will go. fetch the font using HTTP at runtime. and you'll be able to see it in the app. you see even in the dependencies you. have the HTTP package that one that. we've already used. right the con is that it uses HTTP. fetching. HTTP fetching as we all know can take a. little bit of time and that delay can be. seen when you use Google fonts in your. app it is a visible difference but not. too much. so it depends on you if you want to use. this package or not I'm not going to use. it. I'm going to follow the alternative. method which is registering the font in. pubspect.aml file so as we know we can. register the. Assets in pubspect.aml file but we are. not going to register assets fonts is. different from this thing over here. when we scroll down you'll see a. particular section is dedicated to the. fonts tab we need to use that. so you can add custom fonts to your app. just using this part and you can add. your images or your video all of that. from here. we're going to get to assets as well but. for now let's focus on fonts so I'm just. going to uncomment all of this. all of this and make sure indentation is. right that means the spacing over here. is right because. it matters in yaml files. then here we have several things to. mention first of all we have to mention. the asset and its location. well we don't have any assets but you. can go ahead and install it from. fonts.google.com. you can see your style whichever one you. prefer you can select that style it will. add it and once you've selected all the. Styles you want just click on download. all and it will download it for you in. your system. I already have a few downloaded for me. so I'll just open them. I have later bold and later light which. is what I'm going to use if you want to. use the same font style I'll mention the. link for it in the description below. so now to register it I'm not going to. put these font files in lib folder lip. folder strictly for my DOT code it isn't. going to have any assets or anything. my assets is going to be present in a. separate folder of its own in the root. folder so I'm going to create my own. folder called assets. fonts. here I'm creating two folders because I. don't want to mention ad sets just like. this in the root folder it's quite messy. but I'll create my assets folder then. the fonts folder because. I'm going to have two types of assets. images and fonts. the dummy data that there is this image. this is coming from our assets itself. which are registered in pubspect.aml so. we have to register images as well. that's why I've created the fonts folder. now I can just copy them. also we can open fonts and finder. and paste it over here as soon as we. paste it in the correct folder you will. be able to see later bold and later. light. correctly. sweet now we'll just have assets slash. fonts later light Dot ttf and then we. are going to have assets fonts later. bold.ttf you need to make sure that this. path matches you are in the root folder. so you'll go to assets this folder then. fonts and then you'll Target one. particular file and make sure you do. that correctly. ttf it should match word by word letter. by letter. also the style here is not going to be. italic it is going to be 700 with a. weight you can mention the style it can. be italic or anything else but I want to. want to mention the weight aware because. this little bold font should only get. activated when my weight is 700 and. weight 700 means it is bolded and also. you need to mention your custom font. family name aware so you can go ahead. and pass in later later whatever you. want to call it I'm going to call this. later and make sure control s is pressed. so flood up object is run and then your. contents of the app is there with you. perfect. now we'll go to home page and just to. see if the fonts are loaded properly or. not you can go to body text it. and let's say you type in hello world. save it and we have hello world over. but it's in the corner so we are going. to center it so I'll press Ctrl shift R. the refactoring options and I'm going to. wrap it with the center widget. Also let's put comma for formatting and. when we come away hello world is seeing. but there is no difference in. the font why because if you again go to. pubspect.aml file you'll see that there. are. fonts family and there are. multiple types of fonts you can describe. over here you can have more than one. font family described over here. so if there are multiple font Families. how will flutter know. which font family to use and that is why. it asked you for the family name over. here. the family name for this font. so to make sure you're using the right. font family you need to mention it in. the text so you're going to have Style. textile and textile has a property of. font family and it accepts a string so. you need to mention the font family you. mentioned in the. pubspect.aml file which is later over. here. then save it restart your app and you'll. see a different font is used now. if it still doesn't work for you then. again you have to check font family if. it's the correct thing if the asset is. correctly mentioned check your terminal. debug console if there is any error. or you might want to terminate the app. and restart it again and you'll be able. to see the difference. so anyways I have font family now if I. have. font weight as font weight dot bold I. should be seeing the bolded textile. right and we certainly do. now you might say hey why have we. mentioned two font assets over here. why have you mentioned light and bold. both of them. you can't remove bold right if you just. mentioned later you'll be able to use a. custom font and when you use Font weight. dot bold it will bold it like this for. you. well let's try it I'm going to remove. later bold. restart the app and you see a visible. difference. the textile and all of that is the same. but still. the style over here for this font. changed. that's because font. later boiled is different from later. light which is bolded in this case what. was happening was later light was bolded. so it was less bold however here we are. using later bold which has a distinctive. property of its own. and thus we are using two fonts for one. font family and since we've mentioned. weight 700 it is able to identify when. to use that kind of font. okay. sweet. now let's go ahead and design the app. when we see a wire we have multiple text. we have text over here used we have text. over here even here and it's scattered. all over the app does that mean I'll. have to use this style textile font. family later every time I need to. user text and use a custom textile. or a custom font family. no that can be quite cumbersome just. imagine you have to do it over your your. every single place and if your app gets. bigger and bigger it will be very. difficult to manage it that's why. font family is generally not used for a. particular text you can Define it. overall in your my app in the material. app by using the theme property. so team will set up the overall. typography in your app and that will. work fine so you mentioned theme data. and it has a property of font family. which you can use it requires a string. so mention later where. and now without doing anything without. mentioning any textile it still uses. later. it's not bolded because I removed the. textile font weight dot bowl however if. you bold it it will still work fine. cool so now we have set the overall. typography in the app now let's go ahead. and set up the overall coloring in our. app. now remember in the counter app I told. you. to remember one line which was the color. scheme line well that's what we want to. mention. what I want to do is set up the overall. color for my app and I only have one. main color decided which is this yellow. color what I want is the rest of my. colors the rest of the things. used in my app should be derivative of. that. so I want to mention just one color and. based on that one color the entire color. scheme is going to be generated. so we can use that so let's go ahead and. pass in a color scheme and as soon as we. do that there are multiple arguments we. need to pass in and they are quite a lot. you need to pass brightness primary on. primary secondary on secondary error on. error background on background surface. on Surface. if you don't mention that you'll face. errors. so definitely this is quite a cumbersome. task and many people wouldn't want that. they want to develop a symbol app. where the key focus is. building functional app not generating. an entire UI so for that we have dot. dark which will help you generate a dark. theme. then you have color scheme dot light. which will help you to generate light. theme but you also have color scheme Dot. from seed. so with this you just have to mention. one thing the seed color based on the. seed color the entire coloring of your. app will be set up. and it will work fine for you now think. of terms of. a tree. for a tree to grow you need to pass in a. seed right this is what it requires you. pass in a seed and the tree grows. accordingly if you pass in a watermelon. seed of watermelon thing will be grown. if you have a pomegranate pomegranate. will be grown and so on. same way we need to mention a seed color. which will be the base from which all. other colors will be derived all colors. will be based on. so Mike Seed color is going to be the. yellow color which I've mentioned over. here and. I know the RGB o for it so we are from. RGB o and then I'll mention 254. 206 1 1. so this is the RGB for it. and opacity is full all right now we. have it over here no visible differences. but we've set the overall theme of our. app from. from seed method we are able to generate. the primary secondary surface colors. you'll see over here using the seed. color as a starting point a set of tonal. palettes are constructed these tonal. palettes are based on the material three. color system and provide all the needed. colors for a color scheme. these colors are designed to work well. together and meet contrast requirements. for accessibility. and if you want to know more about it. you can click over here open it and read. about it in the material 3 design. documentation. okay. so now that we have set this up and I. think everything is ready let's go to. the home page and design our app so the. first thing is we need a header now this. header is a bit different all the adders. we have seen in the past require. something like this it should be this. long and it should be present over here. shoes collection and then you have a. search box. now this is quite big for an app bar so. it's definitely not an app bar that we. are going to use we have to custom. create it whenever you have a header. sort of thing it doesn't necessarily. mean you have to use an ABBA it will be. fine if you don't use an ABBA. but it should match whatever design you. have in mind and make it pixel to pixel. so let's go ahead here in the body. I'm going to pass in a column and in the. column I'm going to mention children and. my first child. is going to be a text which will say. shoes collection so shoes will be on one. line and collection on another. so let's go ahead and have text shoes. collection. save it. let's put com up properly so that we. have the right formatting. and we have our shoes collection showing. up at the top. now what I want to do is put shoe. collections bigger bolded and it should. be right below the notch just like we. have it over here. The Notches over here so it's this font. is mentioned over here. so I want it below the notch first of. all we are going to go ahead and improve. the style so we have textile. then we have font weight as fontway dot. bold and font size is let's say. 35 let's save it and we are going to. have shoes collection over here nice now. the problem is it's quite at the top I. don't want it at the top I want. everything starting below the notch so. for this we have a nice widget that we. haven't used till now and that is the. safe area widget so we are going to wrap. it so we are going to have Ctrl shift R. the defactoring options and we're going. to wrap it with a widget which is known. as safe area. what safe area widget does is it ignores. the. top. notch. it avoids the bottom Notch as well or. the bottom. bar over here you can see this line it. avoids that as well. so safe area as the name suggests is a. safe area where notches are not there. and even these bottom things are not. there. now if you see if this shoes collection. automatically comes down and it looks. good. the next thing I want to do is put. collection right below so I'm going to. have shoes. slash n collection. I've put backslash n because as we know. backslash n is used to go to a new line. we have seen this in the dot post we'll. save it and we have shoes collection. over here perfect. the next thing I want is in the same. line as shoes collection I want to put a. search field so for this we know what. widget to use text field but what we. want is both of them to be in the same. line if I mention it below this let's. say I call text field over here and. let's say I do this I have my text field. over here perfect right but the problem. here is this is present right below it I. want it side by side. so to make it side by side I'll have to. wrap text and text field in one. particular widget which is a row. so we are going to have row children and. then we are going to have text and text. field. put it inside save it. and now we have it but the text field. isn't showing up why is that the case. well that's the case because if you. press command J. and let's say you restart your app you. have a bunch of Errors showing up. and. if you want you can go ahead and read. this error to understand what really is. happening but if you don't understand it. don't worry basically I've told it to. you before that text field occupies. maximum width it can get. it takes in as much width. as a device has. so here in a row it is not getting. as much width as the device has because. the text is present over here so it's. overlapping and thinking hey why am I. not getting. the maximum width or you can say the. device width. that's why we need to constrain the text. field. so that it only takes as much space as. it's told it doesn't go ahead and take. the entire device with that's not. allowed. again if you didn't understand just to. explain it to you. the text field has a tendency of taking. as much width as possible on the device. that is why when we had mentioned text. field in a column below. it took the entire device with but here. when we put it inside of a row it. doesn't get the entire device width it. only gets this much width which is not. acceptable by it. because this text is taking some space. so we need to tell it that hey you need. to be fine with this much space you're. getting. so for that we'll have to wrap text. field with a widget and that is the. sized box widget here we are going to. mention the width let's say. 50 maybe that is enough. and then we can save it so we have text. field showing up which is quite small 50. is quite a small width so maybe we want. 250. and this is still not enough maybe 270. and you see we get an error a render. flow error. overflowed by one pixel. so maybe we want 269 but I'm going to go. ahead with 260.. so here's the problem now if I mention. 260 here. it will be different on a pixel emulator. so let's get a pixel emulator up and. running and see how it looks on the. pixel emulator as well. and then we'll be able to decide if it. works fine on all device sizes or not. if it works fine on all device sizes. then we are good with 260 otherwise they. need to be made some changes so pixel. emulator is now up and running and as. you can see we are getting a render flow. error on the pixel screen. so that goes to say that the pixel size. that we have mentioned over here doesn't. work for this case so let's just remove. the size box and think of some other. solution whatever width we mention is. not going to be the same for both. Android and iOS or for different screen. sizes in general. so let's just generalize this problem. what do we want we want this text field. to take as much space as possible after. this shoes collection has taken its. peace. so what we can do first of all is take. this text put it in a padding widget so. there's padding all around it and after. that. we can tell search or text field to take. as much space space as available. so what I'm going to do is press Ctrl. shift R get the refactoring options wrap. it with padding so we have constant. agencies.all but it is not enough I want. it to shift quite a bit so maybe I can. shift it to 20 and this looks better. after that in the text field I'm going. to use another widget. which is called as expanded. what expanded does and it is generally. used in either a row or a column is. it just tells hey take as much space as. much width as possible it doesn't say. hey take the entire device with it says. just take as much space and width as. possible in this row or in this column. wherever you're defining it and now on. both this devices it takes the same. space there's the padding of the text. widget. and after that it has its own text field. right so it works on all screen sizes. so that's the cool thing about using. expanded you don't have to use pixels or. you don't have to mention any height. width Etc you can just use expand it to. tell hey just take as much space as. available in a row or a column. cool now that we have this let's go. ahead and Define or Design This search. field and I'm going to keep the pixel. emulator on the side as long as it's not. bothering me. now let's go ahead and create the search. so what do we want well first of all I. want this text to appear and it should. just be a hint a label wouldn't look. good right if you have search written. over here and when you click on it the. search will go on the top we won't we. don't want that kind of label. we do want hint text so we'll go to the. text field we already know we'll pass in. a decoration input decoration and the. hint text is going to be what search. and if we do that much and let's come. over here save it we have search written. over here that's nice. now I want to bold this text because the. text is not bold and maybe I want to. reduce its height as well. so for that I can do it over here in the. input decoration itself but the problem. here is. whenever I want to create a text field I. want this kind of design I don't want. anything else I want this text to be. bolded. I want my. stuff as it is for every single text. field I create so that's why what I'm. going to do is go to the main dot dot. and in the theme I'm going to define the. input decoration so every time I create. a text field or I use input decoration I. want a similar kind of theme so I'm. going to have input decoration theme and. this doesn't ask for just input. decoration it asks for input decoration. theme so let's go ahead and pass it in. and let's mention the thing that we want. an input decoration theme I want the. hint style to be given a proper style so. we are going to have textile. and here the font weight first of all is. going to be there so we are going to. have font weight dot bold and then we. are going to have font size which is 16.. so this is now bolded and looks better. in my opinion. let's put it over here also let's put a. const here and for the home page as well. peel product cons that's nice. the next thing we want is an icon. so obviously we know what to use prefix. icon because we want it in the front if. you've ordinated it in the back we would. use suffix icon but let's go ahead with. prefix icon and here we can mention our. icon we already know how to use the. icons class so we have icon icons Dot. search. and just to clarify icons dot search. is icon data and this is a widget you. cannot just use icons dot search aware. because icons doesn't extend the widget. class. so we need to wrap it with icon which. takes in an icon data and icons is. an icon data all right. let's save it come away and we have this. now what I want is. the color to be same. so. again for all my. text Fields I want the icon color to. remain the same so I'll come in the. input decoration theme and have prefix. icon color color dot from rgbo. and here I'm going to mention a color. which we have found out one one nine one. one nine one one nine one. so this color is kind of grayish. and you won't see big differences but it. there is a difference. so for every text field I create this is. going to be the theme data I can. obviously override it. for example if I just override the color. over here let's go ahead and type in a. colors.red. the color is now red so you can override. it but if you don't pass anything it. will take the default theme from here. and this will only match particular. things for example input decoration hint. text style can be passed over here and. it will follow that if you pass in a. label style only label will follow this. particular property not hen Style. so if you pass anything over here for. example a color or anything it will. follow that and if you don't pass. anything the default will be what you. mentioned in the theme in the theme data. now the next thing is to put borders. over here and to put a border it can be. a bit different. for every text field we create for. example in the home screen I want I. don't want a text field like this. because here the text field is like this. it goes straight then there's a curve on. the left and then it again goes straight. so I don't want this kind of. text field border for every text field. we create. that's why I'm not going to mention it. in the theme data I'm going to mention. it right over here. so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and add. border. in the decoration I need to add sorry. border and that will include border. like this but this is an abstract class. you already know so we can use outline. input border. or you can use an underline border I. want an outline input border because I. want a clear background or clear border. like this. then I'm going to have Border Side where. Border Side is Border Side like this. the color will be there and color will. be color dot from rgbo 225. 225 225 and one this is another color I. found out from the figma design. so we can paste it over and don't worry. about the warnings as of now if we just. put one constant over here the errors. are gone but. we can't be sure about it yet because. text field requires a controller and. controller cannot be a constant so I'm. not putting it as of now. so there we go we have our Border Side. ready as well. now if we come over here we are able to. see stuff. now what I want is the Border radius to. be present so let's go ahead and pass. the Border radius. so we are going to have bought a radius. border radius Dot. horizontal. you can also use water radius dot. circular but that will be for everywhere. I only want it from the left that's why. I'm going to use border radius Dot. horizontal of course you can also use. only but then you'll have to set top. left. and bottom left both because you want a. curve from your and a curve from here. but I know I want it from the horizontal. totally so I can just mention left here. and let's say I pass in a radius dot. circular of 50. cool now we can save it. we come over here and we have our border. radius looking good only from the left. hand side not from the right hand side. if we add right as well. let's try it out we have something. looking like this and this might be good. for other text fields that we create not. for this so we are going to have a. simple left like this nice this looks. nice now the problem is the color isn't. exactly what I mentioned. so I've mentioned the Border over here. but this color is quite different from. what is over here it is taking the. default color so what I'm going to do is. push this border out. and I'm going to have final border which. is equal to border just like we did in. the. currency converter app as well remember. and we're going to put a constant here. because this is a constant. then we can pass border over here then. we can have enabled border. pass the Border same way and now you see. the design changes enable border is this. border and focus border is the border. that we see right now. so focused border has a predefined color. and it has a predefined color because of. this. seed color. when we passed in color scheme Dot from. seed it generated a design theme of its. own using which. it is giving us this color it thinks. this is a nice color with seed color as. yellow. so let's just remove it and see you see. as soon as I remove seed color it's now. blue the default theme. that's why I've mentioned seed color. aware so that it can generate on its own. but I still don't like. this border color over here. so what I can do is pass in focused. border and pass the border to it as well. so when it's in focus. we get the same overall theme let's. restart and. that restarts it only for iOS not for. Android. so let's go ahead and restart it for. Android as well. now we have restarted and everything. looks great. so this is nice. we are creating uis that will fit. everywhere that's nice the next thing I. need is is this chip. or you can say these filters. so. there are two options we can take here. first one is creating a list of filters. then using list view Builder that we. have already seen on the weather screen. and displaying it over here that sounds. nice right so let's do it we'll go to. our code. and for now let's just wrap everything. in a const after. we start building stuff the text field. might need a controller so we can put it. then. so what I'm going to do is. Define a list so I'm going to have final. list of string filters of companies and. then I'm going to have a list but as. soon as I create this I can't Define a. constant Constructor because the field. filters is initialized as a non-constant. value so I can put Constable here and. that fixes everything because list like. this is a constant but I have what I. want is the company names to be present. in the filters so first of all I'll. mention it I'll have all then I can have. added us then I can have Nike and then I. can have bought out. cool now have all of those filters now I. can use a list view Builder to display. them on the screen. so let's have. a list view Builder this will take in a. context and an index. then we can have an item count and as. you can see as soon as we put a list. view Builder we get errors all over the. place and that's because listview. Builder is not a constant so let's go. ahead remove it and add a constant for. every single widget. that looks nice. now in item count what is our item count. well whatever or how many filters are. present over here. my filters here are filters dot length. and this crosses my mind that yeah you. could use a row here to display these. widgets but again if you have more. categories or more filters in the future. for your application not just four. things maybe you have a fifth brand Puma. or something as well you want to add it. you can do that by just mentioning the. value over here and everything else will. take care of itself. you only have to update the value over. here you don't have to go like hey. since I added one value I'll have to add. one more widget no filters.length will. take care of it. because you are specifying the value as. let's say this is 4 so it will build. four times if you add a Fifth Element it. will build five times and it will build. according to the data we pass and the. data I want to pass in over here is. these name of the companies only. so let's go ahead now how do I create. this kind of UI right this looks quite. interesting. so to create this kind of UI there is a. widget you can obviously go ahead and. use the container to create this kind of. layout. and that's totally possible but flutter. makes our life easier by providing us. widget for it. and that is the chip widget when you. return a chip you just have to provide. one label and. it will create a chip out of it chip is. this thing only. of course you can create a container and. make it do your work but there's a. widget for it and there are so many. widgets that I won't be able to cover. all of them in this course so you need. to constantly look up for yourself. if you have a doubt you can ask it on. Google. or on our Discord server and you'll be. getting help for it. but if there is no specific widget for. it you can create your own combination. of widget and get it working. anyways coming back to the label what is. our label well it's these texts only so. I want filters at index whatever we are. building for. so we are going to have final filter is. equal to filters at index then I'm going. to have the label which requires a. widget so I'm going to pass in a text. which will be a filter save it we come. over here. and we see nothing why let's open the. debug console and we again have an error. and this error is quite similar to what. we had before when we laid out a text. feed. the problem is the same list view. Builder wants to take the entire height. of the screen and you're not giving it. that now if I. remove this thing also I think I've made. a mistake here. I should not be passing in a row. I should be passing it out of the column. now this is a mistake you need to. understand this. I had passed in a row. okay so it consisted of these two things. it consisted of these two things in a. row now what I want is an element over. here so I need to pass it in a column. which I have already created right I. have a column over here. so I need to mention my chip or my list. view Builder out of this widget of row. okay. so I can come down over here. I've put the list view Builder but the. problem Still Remains the Same it wants. the entire height of the screen and it's. not getting the entire height of the. screen. so now we want to restrict the height so. for this we have already seen we can use. size box now if I use expanded over here. and save it yeah I do see stuff but. what's happening is it's taking the. entire width of the screen I don't want. it to take the entire height of the. screen in any case I only wanted to take. as much height as I tell it to take. so what I'm going to do is wrap it with. a sized box instead and then I'm going. to mention a height of let's say 120. then save it and I have this now you see. I have a scrollable list of filters. now I'm going to go here and pass in a. scroll Direction which will be access. dot horizontal so everything is. horizontal now but we need a padding. like a margin sort of thing that we have. here between every chip so let's add. that we're going to wrap chip with a. padding widget. and if I do constant Edge and such dot. all it will be from all the sites I only. want it from the horizontal side I don't. want it from the vertical side right. so I'm going to have dot symmetric I can. use dot only left 8 and write it but. does the same as doing Dot symmetric. horizontal 8. I hope you're getting it. we've already discussed about this but. I'm still clarifying in case you didn't. understand it then and here we have our. widgets showing up perfect now I only. want to increase their. height. now to increase their height what should. I do. does Chip have a height property let's. see. it doesn't have anything height or size. related. so what I need to use is a padding. to increase the height of the. chip I'm just going to increase the. padding around it so it increases the. padding. and this will become bigger. so to I've already passed in a padding. over here right and it looked at the. outside it didn't look at the inside of. the chip widget. and that's why chip also has a padding. property of its own. you can pass that in so you have padding. Edge and sets Dot. then you can pass in all or symmetric. whatever you want if I pass an agent. search dot all 15.. this looks good not bad but the problem. I have with it is. it's not looking as good as I want it to. look so what I'm going to do is I'm. going to increase its padding from the. horizontal side and make it different. for the vertical side so that will give. me a better feel of it. so what I'm going to do is Edge in such. dot symmetric then I'm going to have. horizontal as 20 and vertical as 15.. save it also put Constable here and. there we go. this looks much better and is as similar. as this right. but yeah the text is quite small so. let's make the label style bigger we. have label here so we can either pass in. a style over here or a label style for. it so we have label style and then we. can have textile. font size 16.. then also put a const around it save it. and become aware and this looks better. it is scrollable over here it might be. extending. this part and that is why we are not. getting an error if we wrapped it with a. row we would get an error and then we. would have to wrap it with a single. child scroll view what we've seen in the. weather app before. but anyways coming back to this this. looks nice. the last problem or the second last. problem is the color so let's change the. color and for every chip that I create. I want a particular color to be present. so I can change the chip color from here. I'll pass in the background color and. the background color can be. constant color dot from rgbo and then. you mentioned the rgbo which will be 245. 247. 249 and 1. then we save it you come over. here and we see the similar coloring now. obviously this looks a bit different. from this one but if you take a. screenshot save it away and get it side. by side. both of them will look similar just to. make this look more prominent what I'm. going to do is add a border as well so. your chip also allows us to pass in. something known as a side and we already. know what Border Side does it will help. us to create a border of a particular. color so I can pass in a border side. which will have a color of the same. thing as this one so I'm going to have. constant color as this also let's put a. constier. save it become aware and this does look. more prominent okay. and the last thing I want to do here is. make the Border radius more curved. so I want this to be more curved just. like this one so I can decrease the. Border radius. so for that we also have another. property which is the shape that will. allow us to do that so we have rounded. rectangular border where you can mention. border radius and that will be border. radius dot circular. 30. it's all tried and tested values all. right when I was building the app for. the first time I tried values like 10 15. 20 30 and whichever one I liked I kept. it and I like 30 so here it is and this. looks. exactly like this one all right. now the next thing I want to do is the. selection of this chip so whenever I. select a particular chip. I want that particular chip to have a. yellowish color so for this my plan is. very simple. I obviously need to know what filter is. selected so that I can filter. accordingly so I need to know that yeah. all is selected so I want to show all. the products I want to know added also. selected so that I can filter all the. Adidas products and so on so I. definitely need to know that what filter. was selected so I need to store the name. of this filter so I'll be using a string. to store my state. after that you know whatever is clicked. on I can just use gesture detector to. know which one was tap and then save it. in my state. so for that I'll have to convert this. from a stateless to a stateful widget. let's do that. then I'm going to create another. variable which is string selected filter. and that will be equal to filters at. zero but when I try to do this it says. the instance member filters can't be. accessed in an initializer. it basically means that hey you've. created the list of filters over here. and now you're saying you want to use. filters at zero you can't use an. initialized value again in to initialize. something else. so what you can do instead is use late. string selected filter and then use NH. State because this is the first thing. that calls before the build function. and then we can set selected filter. equal to filters at zero and that will. work fine. okay all right. now what I'm going to do is take. selected filter and whenever I tap on. the chip so let's see if tab has Chip. Hazard on top property. and it doesn't. so we'll have to wrap the chip with a. gesture detector widget now here's the. question should I wrap the gesture. detector property with chip. or should I wrap padding with gesture. detector. meaning gesture detector should be used. like this like wrap with Widget gesture. detector should be used like this. let's see if I use on tap and let's say. I just print hi. if I do this press command J. let's restart the entire app. and we'll do the same for iPhone as well. we'll come away and let's say we select. added us High gets printed that's. correct but if I print. outside of added off let's say over here. it still prints why because you've. wrapped it around a padding widget what. padding does is it's saying that. this particular thing this part is One. widget this part is One widget. it is not just including this particular. widget it is also including stuff on the. side. because that's what padding does padding. creates. a spacing. an empty spacing from the left and the. right hand side. so that's what padding is doing and in. closing it with a gesture detector. you're saying that whenever I click over. here. I want a particular filter to be. selected and that's not how my app is. going to work my app is going to work. only when the chip is clicked on so I'm. going to remove the gesture detector. from your I'll press command Z. then I'll wrap the chip widget with a. gesture detector. and then I'm going to have on tap. print let's say hi. then I come over here I click on added. as it prints but when I click outside of. added auth it is not printing cool. so it was a very minor. thing but it definitely helps to improve. the logic. yo so coming back to what I wanted to do. selected filter should be equal to the. filter we have over here right so you. have selected filter which is equal to. filter save it. and. yeah we've just made short selected. filter is changed now I want the. background color to change according to. what the selected filter is. so if selected filter is equal to filter. so if selected filter what we have. selected is equal to the filter that we. are on so if added off is there and it's. clicked on the selected filter and the. filter is the same thing so I want the. yellow color to be there so if selected. filter is equal to filter then I want. the yellow color. and whenever you find yourself repeating. many colors what you can do is set up. the theme for it now I want to access. the seed color so what I can do is theme. dot of context. Dot color scheme dot seed color but. there's nothing like seed color given by. color scheme then what should I use. that's the point of seed color scheme. Dot from seed is basically like hey. give me a seed and I'll build everything. based on it. there's no seed color in color scheme. class. in this class of color scheme there's. nothing like. seed color so we cannot use it what can. we use well we can try to use primary. right and when we come aware the primary. is quite different from what I wanted my. primary to be. my primary was supposed to be yellow. but it's not yellow. because we have built from seed so when. we have built from seed adjusters it has. predefined some colors that will look. good and it thinks this is a good color. for a chip and I disagree I wanted. something else so what I can do here is. override the existing color. so I'll just say the primary color. should also be this and when I do this. and let's say I restart my app you see. yellow color is there and it looks good. I'll restart it on Pixel emulator as. well. and you see it looks nice. so again to explain what happened over. here. we generated from seed seed color is. just there so that it can build stuff. for you. it can build colors for you and. automatically assign them so it. created the primary color also for you. but I didn't like the primary color. generated so what I did was replaced it. with my own primary color. and here is my primary color rest of the. things like secondary color or. surface color all of that can be defined. by this color scheme only I only want. the primary color here to change and. then to access it what I've done is. theme.off context dot color scheme dot. primary to understand how this works. behind the scenes I'm going to. demonstrate or create a diagram for you. and once we understand theme dot off. context.color scheme.primary like how is. this actually fetching this primary. color we'll understand the basics of. State Management the basic principles of. State Management in flutter so this is. how it works let's say you have a root. widget and the root of your widget is. this all right and here I'm going to. have root written so this is the root of. our widget and let's put the root widget. yeah this looks good. and the root widget is followed by our. widget tree so we have one widget over. here and let's say there are multiple. other widgets and then every widget has. its own sub widgets as well like column. it has multiple children so you can have. those as well. let's say this is our entire widget tree. a very simple demonstration all right. and let's say this is our material app. so after root we directly have our. material app. in the material app we have set up the. theme and all of that stuff so we have. all the stuff related to. theming all right. now material lab behind the scenes. configures all of the theme related. stuff and sets it up globally for your. entire app so it does that behind the. scenes so it has all the theme related. data over here so let's call this theme. data now in some descending widget let's. say in this widget. what I've done is called our. theme dot off context right this is the. main part theme dot off context. by calling theme dot off context you're. triggering something known as inherited. widget so if we just come over here to. the home page go to theme. we see a stateless widget but when we go. to theme dot off context. we have inherited theme and if we go to. inherited theme it extends a narrated. theme and inherited theme extends. inherited widget. so we are using something known as the. narrated widget which we've talked about. a lot. whenever we talked about widgets so. there are three types of widgets. stateless stateful and inherited. but we never got the opportunity to say. that. where do we use an edited wizard this is. where you use a narrated widget. inherited widget is used for State. Management by the flutter framework. whenever it wants to talk to the parent. widget as of now we've seen that. whenever we want some data to be passed. to the child how we do that is by. Constructor so if material wants to give. something to our home page it will pass. it through the Constructor if home page. wants to give something to some other. widget it will pass it through the. Constructor again if it wants to pass. something to the Constructor it can do. that but how will we do it in reverse. for that State Management is there and. another problem here is what if my. material app doesn't want to keep. passing everything to the build function. or through the Constructor right every. time it has to go through the. Constructor that is quite cumbersome. when you have a large widget set. right now we only have four so it. doesn't matter. for you but later on when we have bigger. widget tree you'll say hey this is such. a bigger budget tree do I have to pass. it through the Constructor every single. time and this is where inherited widget. will help you inherited widget will just. say hey you want me to pass some data. down to the widget tree you can pass it. to any widget like this. so it will just skip it it will skip all. the Constructor part and it will. directly have. the data given to it so this is what. theme dot off context does it will just. tell the parent. widget whenever it sees the theme widget. it is just going to go there and grab. the data from it to repeat what I said. how theme dot off context works is it. goes up the widget tree and starts. finding the nearest theme widget as soon. as it finds a nearest theme widget. it will grab the properties of it and. use whatever is necessary so if team. data was mentioned over here. let's say theme data was also present. over here and team data was also present. over here both the places so theme dot. off context is directly going to go to. this theme data it won't go to this. theme data it won't go because it will. find the nearest theme data widget for. it. that is how team.off context works so. basically what team dot off context does. is find its nearest widget its nearest. ancestor widget of the same type since. this is team it will also find theme. later on we'll see stuff life now like. Navigator dot off context. even then what it does is. find the nearest Navigator widget. and use that to display its routes or. you know do its navigation stuff but. we'll get to it but this is how team.off. context works and this is how inherited. widgets work. we are not going to write code in. inherited widget if you want to do that. I'll mention a resource below which is. created by the flutter team themselves. and that will provide you with a clear. description however what I'm going to do. is just explain how theme data works. so if you've understood you can skip it. and if you've not understood I'm going. to explain it again how this works is. whenever you call theme dot off context. this off context goes ahead and Finds. Its nearest ancestor widget. so it will go and search for any theme. widget that is nearest to it and once it. finds it we get theme data it will use. the properties mentioned over there. suppose if theme data is not mentioned. over here. it will go to the root widget to find. the theme data. and even if it's not mentioned in the. theme data root it will still have it. because material lab behind the scenes. does create a theme data if you want to. mention it. and change it you can change it but if. you don't mention and change it. then it will use the default theme the. blue color theme or the pink color theme. it has already created all right so I. hope you understood this explanation. this is what it does this is inherited. widget and this is how State management. in general works with flutter. we are going to take a look at a similar. thing in Navigator as well I'm going to. explain it then. so if you didn't understand it now an. opportunity will be later on however I. would still recommend you to understand. it right now so coming back to this we. have selected filter is equal to filter. and when we have this it will have a. color scheme dot primary so it goes and. finds its nearest theme data widget it. found it and then it will access its. color scheme primary widget perfect. now if I try to change it it doesn't. change why well that's because the. selected filter is equal to filter but. you've not called set state. when we have not called such State. however there. widget rebuild that's why we need to. wrap it with a such state so that the. build function rebuilds and then we can. properly select a particular widget. perfect now that we have this done as. well. let's just get rid of the warnings by. protecting a const over here. now the next thing after the list view. Builder and the size box in the column. is displaying these cards. our data so let's save it let's close. all the save files I'm going to go in. the lib folder and create a new variable. or a new file called Global. variables.dot and this contains my. Global variables and file. and my Global variable. is the dummy data that I want so my. dummy data is going to be a list of maps. string comma Dynamic so it is going to. contain a list of products and my. products are going to be mentioned in. the form of a map. so we are going to have a final list of. map string comma Dynamic why dynamic. because we also have a price to mention. let me give you an example let's have a. final products. which is equal to a list and this list. is going to have a map. first of all there's going to be a title. of the product so let's say the title is. men. and then I want apostrophe s but if I do. that it will give me an error so I'll. put a backslash. so it will ignore. this. single inverted comma. and act as if this is a normal single. inverted comma all right then yeah men's. Nike shoes we save it. now you won't be able to see anything on. the screen. obviously we have not displayed anything. the next thing we need is a price so. we'll go ahead and set the price let's. say 44.52. now all to all the shoes enthusiasts if. the value is incorrect forgive me for it. then you are going to have sizes this is. a list of sizes from which the user can. select and this is shown on the product. details screen so we have 8 comma 5 and. 9 comma 10 comma 11. so I hope you are. understanding why this is a list of map. string comma object or dynamic then I. want the image URL and this image URL. right now is going to be an asset later. on it's going to be coming from the web. itself because when the user uploads the. image from the device it is going to be. stored in the database and then we are. going to get the URL from the database. to display it on the web now if you. don't understand it don't worry don't. worry at all just. know that this image URL is the. URL we are going to have in the assets. so let's go ahead and create an images. tab and import all the images now you. can find anything from web. which is a shoe and you can paste it for. yourself but I already have it with me. if you want the same images as me you. can find it in the description again. below. Also let's open this images and. finder let's paste it. come over here we have all the images. you can view it in vs code itself that's. nice. now I can go to the pubspect.aml file. scroll up we have assets images. I can just uncomment everything and. mention the path to my images just like. we did for font so I'm going to have. assets slash Images slash shoes. underscore one dot PNG and you need to. do that for all them. shoes one two three four so let's go. ahead and type it out. now yeah it depends on you if you want. to do it for all the images you can do. it one by one or you can just exclude. everything and just have assets slash. images. slash you need to put this slash here if. you don't put a slash. and you put it like this it will think. images is some sort of file. and if you put a slash away it will. think Images slash is a folder so we. need to import everything in this folder. so if you do this it will import all the. images to your obspect.yaml in your. flutter. project. now you can use anything. inside of your app now a disadvantage of. doing Images slash. is suppose you add some other image. which is not related to your app but. just to test it out let's say I add. shoes underscore file and I never use it. in my app. but I've still registered it. that will add unnecessary weight or. unnecessary. size to my application and we want to. reduce it as much as possible so yeah. always try to reduce the application. size. great now we can close this and we can. mention the image URL we have assets. slash Images slash shoes. underscore one dot PNG. now you can copy paste this again and. again so that you have appropriate stuff. so I'm going to paste it four times now. if you don't want to write all of this. by yourself. what you can do instead. is check the description of the video. there you'll find a link and you can. copy all of the product data from there. which is what I'm going to do. so I can select everything paste it over. here and I have products I did miss one. thing which was or two things ID and. Company. so what company is this or what brand is. this shoe off. this will help us to figure out how to. filter things and then an ID for every. product. and then we have the correct image URL. for everything. we also have another thing over here. which is the cart I hope you copied that. as well and that is a dummy data for the. stuff to be shown in the cart later on. when we add State Management it is going. to be dynamic but just when we are. creating the UI we want it simple right. so we will just have our card as a dummy. data perfect now let's close this go to. the home page. and just before the column ends because. I still want it in a column right we. have our first element of the column a. row then the second element has a list. view Builder and the third element. well what is this going to be. this is going to be a list view Builder. as well right. this is going to be a list view Builder. because. I want to build all the products. that I can see products.link and I want. to display a product card for it every. single time I have that. so we are going to use a list view. Builder as well so I'll type out list. view Builder like this and then we are. going to get a context index and that's. it we also need to specify the item. count we've used lets you Builder quite. a few times so we know what to use but. now we need access to the global. variable products so we can just type in. products like this dot length and make. sure that you import the global. variables package from Shop app fillet. which is our own package all right. so now we have access to the products. and now we can extract one particular. product using products at particular. index. so now we have access to each of the. product here. and now we want to design how the. product card should look like it should. look like this. and I'm not going to go ahead and return. let's say a container over here because. this can get quite big so what I'm going. to do is extract this out in a separate. widget of its own and call this product. underscore card dot dot. then I'll import material.dot. then I'm going to have a stateless. widget. and I'm going to call this product card. all right I'm also going to return a. container. and let's go ahead and make this card. now here you have two options to use you. can either use a card widget or a. container which one will you use here. well you can use both of them and style. it according to the way you want but I'm. going to go ahead with container because. card will give me an elevation it gives. me it will give me a shadow effect. behind and I don't want any of that. effect I just want a simple. box to be there with color in it so I. can just use a container for that task. and then I'm just going to go ahead and. put in a child and in the child a column. and the column will have children why. because we have three different things. here we have the title we have the price. and then we have the products image URL. okay so let's go ahead and do this so. the first thing is the text so we need. the title and the title is going to vary. for everything. so we can take it from The Constructor. just like we did with the weather app. right. so we can have. final string title then we are going to. require this through the named argument. and then I'm going to have title passed. it over here. great also since it is giving us this. warning and I want to get rid of this. warning I'm going to put a color over. here and the color of the container is. going to be this particular color so. what is this particular color. well it can be color dot from rgbo. 216 240. 253. comma 1 okay so r value is 216 G is 240. 253 is blue and opacity is one and if I. save this I see nothing because I. haven't returned the product card so. let's go ahead and return it over here. I'll return product card and the title. is let's say hi okay I'll save it and. nothing shows up on the screen why we. are expecting a list view Builder right. but if we open the debug console I see. these errors. why is this error well again the same. thing unless you build it wants to take. the entire width or our entire height. but it's not getting the entire height. so we need to give it the. amount of height we want to give it and. what should the height be here well it. should be the entire remaining screen. right we cannot give it like size box. 400 because then on certain screens it. will only take a level this long and on. certain screens it will take the entire. height so for this reason I am going to. wrap it with. a widget of expanded so it will take the. all amount of possible space and here we. see high perfect. and we have I guess four products. returned and even in a global variables. we have four products so that means we. are doing the correct thing nice. now I'm going to go ahead and put a size. box of height five. and after that I'm going to put a price. so the price is going to be dollar. something and that something is going to. come from the Constructor again so I'm. going to final string or final double. price. and then we're going to require this. price so we have required this dot price. and then we can have dollar dollar price. but now we have two dollars and it. thinks we are using the dollar to. half string interpolation So to avoid. that we are going to put. slash. before the first dollar sign so it knows. that we are talking about the real. actual dollar and then it can use string. interpolation for dollar price. perfect. now I can save this much I come away I. see nothing because in the home page I. need to provide a price so the price. right now can be a static value of 25.2. come over here and we see dollar 25.2. that's great. and the final thing I need is my images. to show up so again I'll leave a size. box of height 5. now how do we show. images in flutter apps that's not what. we have seen. so to do that we have the image widget. right we have this image which you can. use. to display stuff. and then this requires an image property. which requires image provider so we can. pass an image. provider here and you see it's an. abstract class so again we need to use a. subtype of image provider and whenever. there is abstract class abstract class. is only created in such cases because. there are multiple types you can pass to. it for example this image can be from. assets what we have mentioned in our app. it can be from Network that means it's. coming from the web and you want to. display it. so there can be multiple types that's. why the abstract classes are created. that's why we can just search for asset. image. and you can pass it over here and this. asset image requires an asset name so. our asset name is going to come from. here again so you're going to have final. string image. required. this dot image now I can take this image. put it in asset image and we're done. now. we can come here. path in an image and for image we'll. have to use this product so we can go. ahead and use product image URL. as string all right we need to use as. string over here because. in global variables products is defined. as list of map of string comma object it. thinks it's an object. not a particular value. or not dynamic so that's why we need to. tell it that yeah we are sure that this. is a string. and we can do the same things over here. since we've already done it product. price as double and. product. title as string right. now we can come over here and we see our. images are showing up nicely and it is. scrollable. so that's good now first thing we need. to do is make sure the height is. constrained it's not whatever it wants. to be so let's go ahead and. use it. so an asset image we cannot specify the. height but an image. we do have a property of height so we. can go ahead and pass the height as. let's say 175 if we do that it will only. take as much height as we tell it to all. right. great. now instead of using image like this. a smaller option can be image dot asset. then you directly mention the asset. and you can also specify the height over. here. and you're done so this is just a. shorter option of doing the same thing. you can use it. because it's the same image widget that. we are using but now it has. dot asset to it attached. so it is a Constructor thing and it just. simplifies a task if we want it to and. you'll see no difference over here. perfect. now we do have a white patch over here. and that white batch is visible over. here as well and that's simply because. of the image we've chosen the image is. like this that's why we are getting the. white patch okay great now that we have. image.asset in place the next thing I. want to do is increase the height of all. of these things. so I want a particular textile for this. thing so what I'm going to do is. generalize it in main.dot for text theme. right so I'll come over here and add. text theme. this allows me to pass in typography. or theming of text all right now I can. pass in the text themes I want to use. and I'm doing this because I want to. reuse my. titles everywhere I use all right so if. I am using a text title over here I want. that particular theme to be used in some. other. text theme as well that is why I'm. mentioning it over here you'll see it. later on as we reuse these text themes. the main point of me doing all of this. and setting up the text theme over here. is just reusability. I can change the text theme from one. particular place and it will reflect all. over the app that's what I want. so anyways I'll go ahead and mention. title medium which is what I'm going to. specify for. this thing over your title medium. so the textile here is going to be font. weight font weight dot bold because I. want it bolded and the fonts. size I want to use the size so the font. size will be 20. quite small because our. main title this title over here is 35.. so I want it smaller than that and much. smaller than that. and now if I do that there's no visible. changes over here because this text is. on its own it doesn't inherit the. properties I've defined over here so I. want to make sure that it inherits those. properties or you know just starts. taking those properties not inherits. but starts taking those properties so I. am going to put style and that will be. theme dot off context. so you see the context is helping us. away a. to find the particular widget in the. widget tree that's what we had discussed. right context will always help us to. locate a particular widget that's why we. are passing the context over here and. even if we go to the function definition. you'll find inherited theme is equal to. context it uses the context to find the. particular inherited widget of that type. so it uses context to find another. widget of the same type this is where. context can help so here I am going to. do theme dot of context dot text theme. Dot. and here what is the style admission. title medium so I'm going to mention. title medium here perfect and when I do. that. it looks good perfect. now what I want to do is set the style. for this dollar 44.52 as well. so let's go ahead and the main.dot file. and here I'm going to mention. either title small or body small you can. use whatever and please note that these. font sizes like title medium body small. these are used by certain widgets. when they want to set up text for. example Abba Abba uses one of the. properties from your like title Lodge to. display text on the screen. so text theme has a bunch of values. already there you can see it over here. if we don't don't mention anything. they have a style of their own but if we. do mention it it will override those. existing stuff and app bar like widgets. so for example if I put app bar text. text uses this text themes property like. title Lodge to display stuff on the. screen I'm going to share it to you when. we go to the product details screen. you'll see that okay. so we come over here set up body small. now you can set anything but I'm setting. it body small because I want. the body to be small everywhere so I can. have textile. and font weight can be font weight dot. bold again and font size can be 16. so. it's smaller than the title medium but. it's still small. now I can come over here I'll copy the. style I'll paste it for the price but. instead of title medium I'm going to. have body small okay now if I come over. here dollar 44.52 this is nice. Gray. so we have all of this set up but still. there are problems. if you compare it with your there are. many problems so the first problem I. want to fix. is the alignment issue so everything is. in the center I want everything to be in. the left hand side. so in the column I'm going to set the. cross access alignment obviously I want. it in the start. and it's a column. so I'll have cross access alignment dot. start we'll save it and everything. shifts over here. but I still want padding to be present. so what will I do. I'll wrap this column in a padding. widget. I hope you're getting the hang of it. whatever you can think of this is what I. want to do you can display it on the. screen. so I just thought that I wanted this to. be a little bit away from everything. from the left from the top so I just use. the padding widget it should come. intuitively to you. now instead of all I can have. agencies.all 16 and this looks better. now the problem here is the image isn't. centered. I want it to be in the center I don't. want it in the left hand side just after. the padding is done no. so what I'm going to do here is. wrap the image in a center. you can use align property you can use. some other thing you can think of but. I'm going to go ahead and Center it and. yeah that's easy. the next thing I want to do is make sure. that I leave some space from here you. see. there is space between every card and. there is space. from the device width as well. so again we'll have to use the margin. property of the container since we are. in a container we don't have to wrap. anything. so I can just do that so I'll have. margin agent sets Dot. all 20.. also I can put Constable save it and. there we go perfect. now you might think hey since you. already have a container why are we. using a padding over here why can't we. just take this padding and push it over. here and then you can remove the widget. you can remove the widget by doing so. save it and yeah things are still the. same if you thought this way then. congrats you're becoming a better. flutter developer. you have your Basics nailed down since. we already have a container there's. margin property and there's also padding. and I've already explained the. difference between the margin and. padding to you. so we don't need the extra padding. widget now if you put it there's no harm. but why do you want multiple widgets. when one widget can do it for you. sweet the next thing I want is. the border to be curved and that should. make my entire app better. so how do I make this curved. does container have a property for that. not really there's no order related. property. but we do have something known as. decoration. and this requires decoration which is. again an abstract class. so you can't instantiate it however you. can use box decoration which is. generally used with flutter. so you can use that over here and. box decoration will allow you to pass in. a color which you've already done but. you'll see why we need a color over here. then we have an image that we can pass. in yep we can pass a container image. then border border radius border radius. is what we want we want to put that nice. curves. so we can put that. and now we can have border radius dot. circular 20.. again tried and tested values you can. just keep using it and now we see an. error as soon as we provide border. radius it is giving me an error why so. let's try to remove water radius and C. if I remove water radius I still have. this error. so this has something to do with box. decoration if I remove box decoration. and save the errors go away now this. error is there because. you have defined a color over here and. then you've also defined decoration. now if decoration is mentioned then you. have to shift the color from outside to. inside. and then the error goes away however if. you have. no box decoration or decoration. mentioned you only want a color. then that's fine too but both can't be. there decoration and color in a. container cannot be passed the color has. to be moved inside the Box decoration. for it to work now you might ask why. does container have a color property if. box decoration also has a color property. and that's because box decoration isn't. just used for container it is used for. literally every. decoration property so if some other. widget requires decoration property and. a decoration class. you can pass box decoration to it and. then you can also specify the color. also since it requires decoration. something that extends decoration can be. path steer so it's not necessarily box. decoration Maybe. you want something else some other. decoration type. and you can see that over here some. other decoration can be known over here. like shape decoration all right. that's why color was mentioned over here. so yeah the point is if color is defined. in container you cannot. use decoration and if you want to use. decoration Define both of them inside. it's also written in box decoration over. here if you scroll down if color is null. this decoration does not paint the. background color. if image is null this decoration does. not paint a background image and it does. so on and on okay. so let's restart and we come over here. and our app is looking similar not the. same why is it not looking the same. well that's because. the colors are different the first card. is this exact color but the second card. is a different color. and this color if you notice this color. is quite similar to this color. so we need to use this exact color. and we need the background color to. change how should it change well if I. just open the app for you. the first one is blue second one is. white third one is blue again fourth one. is white so this is the pattern we want. how can we have this so to generalize on. even stuff we want. blue color otherwise we want white color. on even stuff as in the index should be. even so this was zero so it was. considered even. so we could mention blue color but as. soon as it became indexed as one it. became odd that's why it has a. background color of white. so we are going to ask for the product. card color here so we are going to have. final color background color and this. will be required through the Constructor. now we can take this background color. pass it to The Container color. save it. come to the home page you have. background color pass to it then you'll. have product. but product does not have any background. color how do you how will you make sure. that product has a background color so. this is the reason why. we have to do something like this so we. need to check if index is even. so if index is even that means it is 0 2. 4 6 8 10.. then what do we want to do so if index. is even I want to give it a particular. color if index is odd then I want to. give it the white color so that's what I. want to do. so I can just have if index is even then. I'm going to have constant color dot. from rgbo. then I'm going to have 216 240 253 1.. otherwise index is not even then I'm. going to have constant color dot from. RGB again but this will be 245 247 249.. 1 what we've used before all right. this is the same color we use for the. chip earlier you can see it over here. so anyways we have this setup and now. you can see the clear difference now our. app is looking much better perfect. so this looks great. the next thing we need is this Bottom. bar and we can add that later on but. first what I want to focus on is. whenever I click on this product the. product Details page should appear. so to show you a real demo if I select. this one I click over here the title. appears the image appears then. some different colored. box appears with the price the available. sizes and the add to cart button. so I want to design this so let's go. ahead and design it so we are going to. go ahead in the lip folder and create. product underscore details underscore. page dot dot. now I'm going to right click over here. and close others so it will close all. the other files over here so I have only. one file to focus on then I'll import. material.dot again. then I will create a state less switcher. and I'm going to call this product. details. page. then again we are going to return a. scaffold and now I want to test how this. looks all right so how can I test it. well for that I can just take this. product details I can go to the main Dot. and replace home page with product. Details page to see the thing right. so yeah we do see an empty screen. also it is continuously showing. performing hot reload for iPhone so I'm. just going to exit that process and I'm. going to select iOS here again. and then going to run it so that should. hopefully work and while that is. happening let's go ahead and design the. product Details page so the first thing. we need is an app bar which just says. details. so we are going to go and have an app. bar title constant text which says. details. save it and we see details over here. with the yellow background. and that yellow background is there. because we have set primary color to. this yellow color. So to avoid that yellow color what I can. do is go to the main dot dot and you. have set up the global theme for my app. bar my app bar should look the same on. every screen so I'm going to set up the. app bar theme over here which I can. obviously change from here as well but. I'm going to do it here because I want. it for every app bar so I'm going to. have an ABBA theme which is going to. have first of all a title textile so the. textile is going to be. font size 20 so I wanted a little bit. bigger and the color should be colors. dot black. okay because this is white as of now. and doing this much the color. changes the next thing I want is it for. it to be transparent. and in my opinion it is not transparent. because we have not said use material 3. to true so we want to make sure that it. is set to true and you see everything. changes. also if we come back to the home page. over here let's put home as home page. and we come here nothing really changes. over here things are still the same. what has changed is the app bar is now. so first of all let's just change it. again product Details page app bar is. now white in color perfect. then we want the title men's Nike shoes. or whatever so for that we'll have to. get access to the product so we are. going to take it from The Constructor. and have final string object which is. product. and then I'm going to require it through. the Constructor so I've required this. dot product. then I'm going to have a body. the body is going to have a column. column is going to have children and the. first child is going to be text which. says product. at particular title which is going to be. treated as a string. cool now if we come to the mean dot dot. you see we have to pass in a Constructor. here and the Constructor is a product so. let's go ahead and pass in we are going. to import products from the. Global variables.dot file and then I'm. going to access the zeroth element now. it says invalid constant value because. this isn't a constant. this is a global variable that can. change so we can have a constant remove. and there we go. so we have men's Nike shoes written over. here now. don't be concerned about products at. zero. we're just passing product Details page. aware so that we can take a look at how. to design the page and after that I'll. tell you how to navigate from one page. to another okay so let's go to the. product Details page here. now what I want to do is set the style. for this men's Nike shoes thing. and if you notice that this. font size and this font style the font. weight and the font size both are very. similar to what we had in the shoes. collection. both are of equal height both have the. equal font weight so both of them are. quite the same so. what I'm going to do and what's going on. in my mind is what if I go in the home. page I copy this textile. I go to the main dot dot. and then I'm going to have a title Lodge. and I'm going to paste this as a textile. so the font weight is bold the font size. is 35. now I can come to the home page and I'm. going to have theme dot of context dot. text theme. Dot. title large. so with this I'll have to remove. constant I'll have to set constant for. this part for this part but the text. style is no longer constant because it. is theme dot off context. great now why have I done this I've. moved this to the global theme and set. it to title lodge because. that's what I want for title Lodge and. now I can reuse this component easily by. just copying this thing. so this textile can be applied to any. text I want to apply it to this text. I'll just pass in the style as this. thing over here. save it and there we go men's Nike shoes. shows up and it's looking really good. the next thing I want is the image but. before that I want spacing to be present. and the thing about spacing and the. tricky part about spacing is this if I. come back to the normal app. if I have this kind of thing the spacing. should decrease. but. if I have this kind of shoe the spacing. should increase so it's relative spacing. right I can't give a fixed value over. here otherwise I'll get render flow. error because this shoe is quite big. so if I put let's say a size box of. height 50 and your I put a size box of. height 50 again that will work but if I. put a size box of height 50 over here. this shoe will go on the top. then I'll have size box of height 50. again and this container will come right. over there so it's not consistent UI. basically and our spacing wire requires. relative spacing so for that particular. reason there's another widget that will. help us to space stuff out and that is. the spacer widget. so if I pass constant spacer like this. the spacer requires something known as a. flex. so anytime you use spacer it will create. a flex of one on your screen and it will. relatively lay it out. so to show it in a diagram form let's. say this is my screen. let's say I have. my text widget over here then I want to. leave some space so I can just leave. some space here this will create a flex. of one then I have suppose my image so. my image is showing up like this then. I'll again have. a spacer so spacer will be like this. this will also create a flex of one and. this will be relative positioning. meaning. the spacing will be carried out like. this by performing a calculation that. there are total flexes on the screen is. equal to 2.. so each Flex is going to take a size of. 1 by 2 on the entire screen. since the number of flexes on the screen. is 2. this space is going to be 1 by 2 and. this space is going to be 1 by 2. so. they equally divide themselves if I add. one more let's say. Flex let's add one more Flex over here. the total Flex will be. 3 and each Flex will take 1 by 3. now a. weird thought comes in what if I want. one of my spacing to take double the. space of another. what if I don't want second space. and this Flex should be bigger all right. it should be twice the height. of how much this Flex is taking. so what will happen I can specify a flex. property to it you see we have Flex. so this can be flexors too this will be. Flex as one so the total Flex is 3 but. this will take one third of the. available space and this will take two. third of the available space. that's how flexes work if you don't. understand this I'm going to demonstrate. a practical example to you but that was. just a diagram so now I've created a. flex of one. now I'm going to use image.assic to. display my image again and that will be. product. at image URL. and we are going to take this as a. string. save it and we come over here. our image is showing up and this is the. previous app. we'll get to this app and our image is. showing right at the bottom not bad. because what has happened over here is. the total Flex is one. since the total Flex over here is 1. it says hey I'll take one out of one. space so it takes all the available. space however if I add another spacer. what happens is. there are two flexors on the screen this. thing right here and this thing right. here so this takes one by two. and this also takes one by two. so both of them take 50 50 of the. available screen space but that is not. cool. because it's simple this should be one. this should be two because this image. should go more up. so your will pass and flex as to save it. come over here this looks good enough. the next thing I want to do is wrap this. image with a padding. so I can do that I can wrap this with a. padding widget. and then I'm going to have Edge and says. dot all 16.. and this looks better. I'm not going to specify any height. width Etc. after this what I want is a container if. you can see over here. What's Happening Here is there's a. container which has its own background. color you can see it over here then it. has its own text with the price then the. available spy sizes you can select from. and then an add to card button so we. need these three components in this. color. so what will you use here and how will. you lay it out well we can use it in a. column first of all that's a good thing. to clear off so let's go ahead and. create a container down below so we're. going to have container. decoration box decoration. then I'll mention a color so the color. is going to be constant. color dot from rgbo and it's going to be. the same color that we had used earlier. for the chip for the second box that was. odd. I mean the box that had even. or odd index. so we're going to have 245. 247. 249 and 1.. after mentioning the color what I'm. going to do is. mention the width as well so the width. over here let's say is 250 I'll save it. and I see nothing on the screen why. because I mentioned the width the. containers with doesn't really matter. here the height matters because the. container is getting the maximum width. because column is taking the maximum. width now because it is in the. scaffold's body. so I can set the height as 250. and you see a container has risen above. where and that looks solid perfect. then I want to make this curved if you. see over here this is also curved so I. want this container to be curved as well. so that's why I had set up box. decoration. so I can use your border radius and the. Border radius will be border radius dot. circular 20 let's say. come over here. and it's hard to see but the Border. radius isn't quite enough. so I'll set it to 40.. and I think this is quite like it so I. like it this way that's good now after. the containers decoration has been done. we can go to the child again column. I hope you're becoming experts in UI it. is so intuitive in my opinion you know I. want everything vertically I can use a. column if I want everything horizontally. I can use a row if I want to put items. in a list I can use a list view Builder. if I want to display a text I can use. text for an image image.asset so I hope. your understanding and getting the hang. of things. then I'm going to mention texture and. the text is going to be well slash. dollar dollar. then I'll have to mention product. price. like this. cool so we have dollar 44.52 showing up. but this now takes only this much space. I want to take the entire width so for. that particular reason I can have double. dot infinity or even if you don't. mention the width it's fine because we. have a list of sizes to display. when we have a list of dial sizes to. display we will be using list view. Builder because. we don't know how many items we are. going to have it's not one particular. value. it can be 9 10 11 12 for one product it. can be eight nine ten for one product it. can be six nine twelve for one product. so the sizes can vary and number of. items can vary that's why I'm using a. list view Builder. when the number of items is not known. you can use list view Builder when the. number of items are known then you might. want to use list view we have not taken. a look at list view but let's do the. same as listview Builder instead of. passing an item count item Builder you. just have to pass in children just like. a column and just mention stuff in it. so anyways we have product price. what I want to do is. make sure this text is big enough and if. you notice this text is as big enough as. this one. so we're just going to have a style of. theme dot of context Dot. text theme. Dot. title launch. if I save this dollar 44.52 shows up. and now. in my column the next thing I'll do is. leave a height I'm not using spacer over. here notice that I'm using a size box. because this isn't relative height. it doesn't really matter if my height is. relatively spaced or not in terms of. images it did matter because I wanted. consistent UI. so anyways we have a size box here that. looks good. so we'll have a height of 10.. and after that we are going to have a. list view Builder that will tell us all. the available sizes. so we are going to have listview Builder. with an item Builder context and index. then you are going to have item count. and the item count is going to be. product sizes dot length. now if we go to Global variables product. sizes so we are doing the correct thing. but we are calling dot length property. on an object so obviously we need to. treat this as. a list of double but if we use it as. list of double then it will give us an. error like this why because you're. seeing list of double dot length you're. not saying product sizes as list double. dot length Okay so you need to wrap it. with the apparent thesis and then you're. done okay. now you can extract one particular size. so you have final size which is equal to. product. at sizes. at particular index. and here it's saying you cannot. invoke. this thing this index unconditionally. because it thinks that product sizes can. be an object which is nullable so what. I'm going to do here is. tell them that yeah this can never be. null and then access the index property. on it but then also I cannot access. index property because there's nothing. like add index on an object. so we need to again treat this as. something so we're going to have as. double. then. I'm going to take this as a whole. also this will be list of double and. then you'll have access to index so what. I've done here is the same thing product. at sizes as list double and then I'm. calling at index to get one particular. size and now I want to return it so I'm. going to return chip. and then the label which will be text. size dot to string perfect. now we'll save this become aware and we. get an error the error is there because. it is saying that list of integer is not. a subtype of list of double so it. considers these sizes to be all integer. and that is true as of now everything is. integer but so let's go ahead and use. that particular thing so we are going to. have as list of integer list of integer. since everything over here size is 9 10. 12 9 10 12 it cannot have a decimal. value right that's why it is an integer. now you can just have list of end. and you see. our UI is not distorted the error goes. away but it is all distorted and it's. again thanks to the list view Builder. again list view Builder wants to take. the entire screen size it's not getting. that so it's just distorting our UI and. giving us a bunch of Errors again wrap. this in either expanded or. sized box I'm going to wrap it in size. box why. very simple. size box will give at a particular. height of 50. so it is constraints. in that particular height all right. and it can't grow bigger than that. Also let's set the scroll direction as. access dot horizontal and everything is. and horizontal Direction. after that I'm just going to wrap my. chip widget with padding widget and I'm. going to have Edge and such dot all 8. and everything is evenly spaced out that. looks cool. after this we finally need add to cart. button and we are done. also I think this dollar 44.52 is right. up we have to center it but we can do. that after we add a button so again. let's go ahead and leave a size box of. height 10. then I'm going to have elevated button. very simple I'm not going to use text. button and the child is going to be. text which says add to cart. save it also we are going to put. constant come aware we have add to cart. button but now we need to style it first. we need a background color then we need. to set the size for it and after that we. might have to change the color of the. text because the color of the text. inside of it is yellow we want to change. it to Black. so let's go ahead we are going to have. style which will be elevated button dot. style from. then we want to set the background color. we've already taken a look at the button. so much it's just. a revisit for you I hope. so now the background color should be. yellow and it's yellow because the. overall theme of my app is yellow so now. I just want to set it to theme dot off. context dot color scheme dot primary. color. so with this it has a primary color of. what we have defined yellow now I want. the minimum size to be there. the minimum size of this button should. be this much and otherwise it can take. whatever it wants so it will be double. dot infinity and height will be 50.. then we can save it come over here. and here is a button add to cart button. has disappeared and that's because that. was already yellow so let's change it. back to black so we are going to set the. style over here which will be textile. color will be colors dot black. and. font size will be 18. let's just make. the font size a little bit bigger this. looks good. now we need some spacing from here right. so obviously. we need padding I hope that stuck your. mind you know this is a way to know that. you're progressing. then you have agencies.all let's say 10. not enough let's try 20. good enough. but the width or the height between both. of them has increased and it has. increased because we have a size box of. height 10 over here then we have. agencies.all 20 so that means the. spacing from here till here is 20 plus. 10 which is 30.. and from all the other sides it's 20.. that's why what I'm going to do is. remove the size box height so from all. the places it is 20 and it looks better. and final thing for the UI here is. I want everything to be in the center so. I'll just access the main column and set. it to main access alignment Dot Center. and there we go this looks awesome. the next thing in this screen what I. want to do is whenever I select a. product I can select a size for it and. we've already done this with the chip. widget. the same thing I want to do over here as. well with the sizing. so I recommend you to try this on your. own and make sure that your logic is. correct and what you're doing is correct. so that you have more confidence in. yourself. so pause the video and try it for. yourself. I hope you were able to do it for. yourself now let's try it together. what I'm going to do first of all is. convert the stateless to a stateful. widget then I'm going to have. end selected size is equal to. 0 let's say so the selected size is 0 at. first. then I take the selected size. so I have in selected size equal to 0. then I'll scroll down. here where did it go the chip yep yeah. I'm going to have a background color of. selected size is equal equal to size so. if it really does match my size then I'm. going to select one thing. so let's say. if it is selected then the color is. theme dot off context dot color scheme. dot primary color. otherwise it is all going to be null. okay. that's nice if the background color is. null that means it takes the default. color that is already given to it. and we get this kind of error now so. let's just restart and there we go there. are is fixed to fix it on Android. emulator we'll click over here restart. and it will start. okay cool now if I select anything still. nothing happens because we have not. updated the value of selected size so. what we need to do is wrap the chip. widget with a gesture detector we are. not going to wrap the padding widget. with gesture detector and I've already. mentioned the reason to you. now uh in the on top I'm going to have. set State don't forget that and selected. size should be equal to size. the size we have extracted over here. and now if I select anything it is. selected perfect. now what I want to do is come back to. the main dot dot I'll. mention home page over here. and this should be a constant I'll come. at the top and remove product details. and Global variables from here. now what I want to do actually is. whenever the user clicks on one. particular product I want to navigate. them from one screen to another how will. I do that well that opens up to a New. Concept and flutter which is Navigator. let's talk about it and how it works so. let's dive in the code for it we are. going to close all the files here and. I'm going to go to one particular page. which is the home page where I have just. one thing. if I scroll down the product card. so I want the product card to be wrapped. with the gesture detector and whenever I. click on that product card. I want to get navigated from one screen. to another. so first of all let's go ahead and wrap. it with gesture detector. then we are going to have on tap you see. there are lots of options gesture. detector provides as well but we're. going to go ahead with on tap and then. on tap what do we want to do well we. want to navigate from home page to. product Details page now since we have. that much Clarity it's easier for us why. we just have to do Navigator dot off. again or Navigator dot off also uses. inherited widget behind the scenes and. context is used to find ancestor State. ancestor State again. so context is helping us find the. nearest Navigator. and using that Navigator. I can navigate from one page to another. then after doing Navigator dot off I get. a bunch of properties over here Focus. node overlay but that's not what I'm. interested in what I'm interested in is. methods like pop push. pop and push name so let's go over them. one by one so first one is pop pop is. basically popping off the screen. now to understand this you'll have to. understand how Navigator really works. let's remove this diagram and draw a. diagram for navigator. think of Navigator as a stack all right. what is the stack well let's just think. of it as. a pile of books on a desk all right so. let's just consider this is a desk. and then you have a bunch of books on. top of it so there is one book. all right then there is another book on. top of it. and then another book on top of it okay. this is how Navigator works it works on. the concept of Stack this is a stack. anything that's above one another is a. stack. and just. as a general information stack is also a. widget in flutter that will help you to. build uis so it has children pass to it. so you can pass one particular widget. which will be the background and after. that. the next widget you pass in will be. above it so if you have text hi then you. have text. hello. that will just make sure that there is. kind of this thing so let's just have. this CC. hi. is there you won't be able to see it but. you see H is kind of. bolded that's because. hi and hello are there so H is. overlapping. so basically high is below hello. so it is stacking up so in this case. high is this thing hello is this thing. and the eyes are over here this is your. eyes right if these are your eyes. and you're looking from your to bottom. what will you see you'll first see Hello. then you'll see hi right and that's why. so this is the general concept of stack. stack is also a data structure. so basically this is the concept on. which Navigator works whenever you call. things like pop. it just pops off and removes off the. topmost screen it will just pop off and. remove off the topmost screen well how. do you add screens on the top that would. be the biggest question. well for that. you use Navigator dot off context dot. push so what push does is it has one. widget it will just stack it above. another again you push something from. One widget to another it will just put. it on top of another widget so this is. our push works and pop just removes of a. particular widget. just think in terms of our array right. it also works on the concept of Stack. right if you use two. and then you use add function to add the. number three it will add it to the last. then you use push to add four so you. will be adding 4 to our array and then. when you want to remove something or pop. something. it will remove it from the last unless. you specify what kind of. page you want to or what kind of number. you want to remove so it's kind of like. a list but in general it is called stack. okay so now I want to call Push because. I want to push it now here's another. important concept which is of this thing. push. replacement. so what push replacement does is if you. call navigator.off context dot push. replacement from this screen. it will replace this entire screen with. a different screen altogether so this is. out of the picture now now if you call. Pop after that it will pop this screen. and will give you the screen back. so replace push replacement just. replaces the entire thing entirely it. just removes it from the stack. with itself. and then when you call pop it will just. pop this thing. so I hope you understood that. now we have Push replacement here not. push replacement I want Push and what. push requires here is something known as. route. and generally what we pass over here is. material page route. or a Cupertino page route. or something that basically extends mati. uh just a page route all right so you. have page route Builder that you can. pass away or anything that has or. extends page routing why do we have to. do this well it's boilerplate code but. we have to do material page route. because what you're doing is. trying to add a platform adaptive. transition here. so moving from one screen to another. looks different on different devices. and those are transitions the way they. do it on iOS it might be different from. for iOS it might be different that's why. so you need to mention material page. routing and here you can mention more. settings but I hardly ever use any of. them. then it requires Builder. that requires a context or that gives. the context which you can use. so we have this and here what do we have. to pass well we have to return a widget. from here what Widget the widget you. want to transition to you want to move. to so I want to move to the product. details screen so I'm going to return it. from here. and I'm also going to pass in the. product that I have extracted here. perfect now if I save it I'll restart my. app. and when I click over here I go to the. particular product if I click over here. I go to Adidas shoes. if I click over here I go to Bata. women's shoes now I know the images are. incorrect but forgive me for that this. is just about learning. all the images and illustrations used. here are incorrect I know. so we can close this and yeah this works. well. now just to demonstrate what I was. talking if I use replace surveyor. not replace push replacement. then what will happen is when I click. over here I won't be able to go back. when I try to go back I won't be able to. on Android emulator to go back I have to. click this when I try to do that I won't. be able to do obviously. only when I. click over here. when I try to go back I just exit the. app. again when I try to open the app you. know I just go back that is how. replacement works I won't be able to go. back from the screen. so obviously push replacement is needed. and stuff like let's say Authentication. so when you have logged in you don't. want the user to go back to the login. screen that's why. you use push replacement that time not. push but in scenarios like this push is. very much needed and you also notice the. difference over here all right let's. have iPhone simulator hot restart when I. click over here and when there's push I. get the back button however when the. push button is not there. it's push replacement then I don't get. any back button. so I hope that was clear and I hope you. understand what the code for navigator. is it's Navigator dot off context then. you either want to push push replacement. pop and there are a bunch of other. things like push and remove until. there's push named which is related to. named routes but we'll get to it when we. start building stuff for the entire web. all right. when we make our layout. good enough for all the screen sizes so. we have push here then we have Push. pop and push restorable push all of that. stuff but the most commonly used is push. push replacement and Pop I don't think. you're going to need anything other than. those 90 of the times obviously so now. that we have understood this I just want. to clear how Navigator works. so in flutter the Navigator is actually. responsible for managing the navigation. stack and handling the transitions. between different screens or routes in. an application. we passed in a material page route and. that handles the navigation you see when. I click over here I get a transition. which goes from right to left but on. Android it goes from bottom to top. you see. not even bottom to top it's kind of like. a fade animation. so it is platform adaptive based on what. platform it is on it will perform that. navigation or that transition. and whenever we call Navigator dot off. context we're basically using inherited. widget it Returns the nearest Navigator. widget. in the widget tree that contains the. build context. exactly like theme Right In theme also. it would go up the widget tree finding. theme class and it would inherit or take. properties from it same thing is. happening for navigator it is going up. the widget tree trying to find Navigator. now you might say hey everyone we have. never. created any Navigator stuff over here. and that's true you've never done it but. material app has. material app behind the scenes creates a. navigator class which you can find when. you just try to look over here all right. you'll be able to find stuff. so material app does it for you. now behind the scenes Navigator. maintains a stack of Route objects which. I told you about which represent the. different screens or routes in your. application I'm saying different screens. or routes because sometimes you might. not want to return a screen when you go. to a particular or when you use. Navigator what you want to show is let's. say a half screen dialog. something like an alert dialog box. something like that so even then. Navigator can help you and those. settings over here which are present for. navigator. in the material page route can help you. like full screen dialogue maintain State. all of that. so those are different routes but. usually you'll be encountering different. screens because to create a dialogue a. pop-up you have several other things. now when you navigate to a new screen. you push a new route onto the stack so. if you want one particular screen so. let's say I have my home page over here. that's the home screen now I want to. pass product details so I'm going to. pass it at the top over here. so I push it on top of the stack and. this is what happens when you navigate. back for example when I click over here. and when I go back when I click on this. back button. navigator.op is called all right and. then you navigate back. from year to year so behind the scenes. navigator.off context Dot. pop is called so it goes back to. whatever screen it came from. so just to summarize if you've. understood you can skip this part. whenever you call Navigator dot off. context it looks for the nearest. Navigator widget in the given tree. and this is typically provided by. material or Cupertino app right at the. top of the widget a hierarchy. a root widget once it finds a navigator. widget it returns an instance of the. Navigator state. now this Navigator state is the thing. that allows us to manipulate the. navigation stack so if you go to. navigator.off context you'll see static. Navigator state so this Navigator state. is the thing. that does most of our work. and it allows us to manipulate the. navigation stack so with the navigate a. state object now you can perform various. navigation operations like we saw. whenever we call Navigator dot off. context it gives us the Navigator State. now with this Navigator State we can. call push pop. push replacement. all of those stuff when you push a new. route. the Navigator animates or transitions. from the previous route to the new route. using transition animation which are. already predefined for platforms on. Android it is like. a fade in transition and for iOS it is a. sliding transition. transitions are there so that it. provides a smooth visual effect it. doesn't go like hey you suddenly change. the screen and you get to know that. these are two different screens. it just is a smooth process and when you. pop her out from the stack the Navigator. reverses the animation bringing back the. previous route so when you click over. here you see we have. right to left and when we click back it. is left to right so it just reverses the. transition. so I hope you understood how Navigator. works and this is how anything that has. dot off context will work. because they are using inherited widget. and that is the biggest concept. in State Management once you understand. that you'll be understanding. Navigator. scaffold messenger that we'll take a. look at. and many State Management tools as well. and I hope you're also understanding the. importance of build context. Bill context is making sure behind the. scenes that you can find the correct. Navigator State widget. because just think about it even in the. flutter source code the flutter source. code is so big and if you want to access. from One widget to another there might. be some way of communication right you. can't just keep going through the. Constructor and keep passing everything. for stuff like these product Details. page Constructor is fine. because it's just one product that you. want to display and storing it in a. state management tool is just stupid. however. in stuff like add to cart. using State Management is required for. example if I have a bottom navigation. barrier. and when I click over there. I should see the card page so that means. I go to the product Details page. I click on add to cart and it should add. it to my cart page. think of it in form of a widget tree if. it's hard to visualize just draw it out. and see or I can do it for you you have. your root widget. then you have your material app. then after the material app you have the. home page. then after the home page there's another. widget you could take which is the cart. page right home page and card page are. shown differently as of now. so if you click one item like the cart. button. in the bottom bar. for example. over here. when you click the cart item you should. be seeing card products so there are two. options you can take now in the home. page if you click on something you can. go to the product Details page. now my card. or my add to cart button is mentioned. inside of this particular widget which. is the product Details page so what I. want to do is whatever I click over here. should be added to a list. and that list should be accessible in a. separate widget as well how do we do. that. how can I make sure that stuff passes. from Child widget to parent widget from. parent widget to its parent widget and. then it can pass it to its sibling. this is quite a cumbersome process you. can do it in flutter but it's quite. cumbersome so instead of doing that what. I'm going to do is introduce State. Management which usually does something. like this. you shift everything down then the State. Management tool will create. a storehouse for itself right at the top. of the widget tree and here. you store all the data. and this is what state management is you. store all the data over here. so what you do is. add to cart from your to your the. changes are made over here and then you. continuously listen. from the card screen to this particular. screen. or this particular storehouse. so just to summarize if you didn't. understand whenever I click on add to. cart button in my app over here it. should be displayed over here so what. I'm going to do is whenever add to cart. button is clicked on I'm going to update. and store all the data in one particular. State Management tool which will be the. head of everything. and whenever I want to read data I'm. going to read everything from this State. Management tool or the storehouse itself. so if I make changes over here. I can read it instantly. if I make deletions updating any stuff. it will automatically be received over. here this particular tool will do that. so this is what we are going to do in. State Management I hope you understood. the concept. because. I'm not going to explain it again I've. already explained that now we'll see it. in the form of code but before that we. still have to get done with the UI and. what I want to create is a bottom bar. wire. which tells you hey do you want to. access cart you can access card from. here so let's go ahead and do that so. let's go ahead and add bottom navigation. bar to both of these things. so let's just close all the save files. from here go to the. home page. and here we are going to set up our. bottom navigation bar because whenever. we return a scaffold we get body we get. the Abba property and we also get a. footer kind of thing which is the bottom. navigation bar this bottom navigation. bar accepts a widget so you can pass. anything over here but there is a. special widget for bottom navigation bar. which is bottom navigation bar itself. here there's a required argument of. items that you need to pass in and it. should be a list of bottom navigation. bar item so we're going to copy this put. it in the list. and then we're going to use that so. we're going to have bottom navigation. bar item. and here we're going to have pass in an. icon. and that's pretty much all there there. is. so the item we want over here or the. icon we want at first is icons dot home. so I want the home icon to be there. and the second item that I require is. bottom navigation bar item which is. shopping bag or shopping cart whatever. you want to use I'll go ahead and use. shopping cart. then you can save it also put a. constable here because both of these. items are constant so the list becomes a. constant. and when you come over here you still. see this error and this error is. basically saying that item.label is not. equal to null so that means the label. property should be added somewhere where. in bottom navigation bar item even. though this is nullable it does require. a label to be passed in but what if I. don't want to pass any label it should. be nothing so I'll just pass in an empty. label here. in both of these things and the error. goes away I see my bottom navigation bar. great. now what I want to do is whenever I. click any of them. I want to navigate to that particular. screen. so for that reason I am going to create. a function. or let's not create a function I am just. going to create a variable that will. keep track of the current page so we. have the current page at zero now I can. copy this current page. and here in the bottom navigation bar we. require two things on tap and current. index so we can pass in the current. index which will be current page so this. is the correct index so this is the. item that we have selected also here. you'll have to pass an i in current page. is equal to one and then when you. restart the app you see. this thing is active now. and the home is the zeroth element or. the zeroth page so yeah. just restart the app and you'll see the. difference. so now whenever this item is being. tapped on we want to change the current. page so that will reflect those changes. right so for that we can use the ontap. property given by bottom navigation bar. or alternative option was to wrap this. bottom navigation bar item. with the gesture detector but that isn't. allowed because this wants a list of. bottom navigation bar items you cannot. put a gesture detector here because. gesture detector is a widget not. particularly bottom navigation bar item. only. so let's go ahead and pass the on tap. here and the on Tab will have a value we. are going to set State and we are going. to set the state of current page equal. to the value this will give us. and then what I'm going to do is Click. over here you see there is a smooth. change over here so we are able to. change the item in the. app but still we are not able to figure. out. how to change the screen how do I show. this particular cart page for this. particular home screen. or how do I show the home page on the. home screen or when the home screen is. active and how do I show cart page when. this is active. so to do that I'll have to do one thing. I'll have to extract the entire body out. in a separate widget of its own so let's. copy this entire widget and let's call. this product list. so we are going to have in the lib. folder a file product underscore list. dot dot then we are going to import. material.dot. and then we are going to create a. stateless widget. which will be product list and here I am. going to return. this entire widget I'll make sure you. understand the purpose but as of now. just follow along also this requires a. border to be passed in and this is the. Border. we are basically taking a widget out. from here and putting it in its separate. own Widget the reason for that I'll. mention in just a minute. also we want filters so we'll have to. convert this product list to a stateful. widget because all the chip and filter. stuff is inside of it. and then we can take this final string. filters out put it in a list come back. over here. then you're going to have a selected. filter then we are going to have our. init State and then I'm just going to. pass in my product list like this okay. so I've successfully extracted out. the product list widget into a separate. widget of its own also I'll copy or cut. all of these import lines and put it. inside of the product list so now all. the errors from product list are also. gone. because things like Global variables so. this thing over here requires Global. variables. where is it the products yup. then product card and product Details. page everything is required and now if I. restart you won't see any visible. differences on the app it will still. feel the same way what has changed. however is we have access to this. product list now changing from. one screen to another becomes easier how. well I'll show it to you what I'm going. to do is create a list of widget which. will be. pages and that will be equal to an empty. list with. product list passed to it and. a cart page so we have to go ahead and. create. card underscore page dot dot import. material dot for it. then we are going to create a stateless. widget call it card page then we are. going to return a scaffold a body. with a centered text and we are going to. name it cart. page so as of now this is what the card. page looks like however we are going to. fill that in we're going to create that. UI really soon so let's copy this card. page and have it over here let's paste. it sweet. so we are going to have const like this. perfect so we have a list of pages now. and that Pages includes product list and. cart page so this is the page that we. want to show. and how do we want to show it well if we. are on zeroth page we want to show the. product list. if we are on. first page I want to show the cart page. so we can have that if condition over. here right I can just have if current. page is equal to 0. then I'm going to have product list. otherwise I'm going to have. cart page. and that should work right so if we just. restart you see card page is showing up. if I go to home page home page is. showing up and it does that correctly. however one small Improvement here could. be if we just do Pages at current page. pause the video and give yourself a time. to understand what I've done if you. don't understand watch the next part. so what I've done over here is. I have Pages product list and card so if. current page is zero then I'll access. the product list which is Pages at zero. if current page is one then I'll access. Pages at 1 which is cart page. so I'm basically. performing the same task but really. smartly. if I add more pages further in the app I. can quickly change it. so this is the thing I don't have to use. the ternary operator anymore and this. feels better however one problem here is. that whenever I scroll and go to another. page then come back everything starts. from scratch you know it just starts. from everything I want that scroll. position to be maintained if I come over. here come back the scroll position. should be maintained so for that we have. a widget called index stack what index. stack does is it stores everything in a. stack. and by Stack I mean it will just keep on. piling stuff so the state doesn't really. go the state is still persisted in. indexed stack so it requires children. and. the children here are the pages so we. can just pass pages over here. because children requires list of widget. and pages is a list of widgets so we can. pass that in. and now the next thing we want is index. so that it knows what page it is on and. the index for us is current page now if. you do that restart. come back over here. scroll and come back the scroll position. is maintained you see if I leave it at. added us like this come here come back. added our scroll position is still. maintained. so index stack allows us to do this. and I hope you understood why I. extracted out the product list it was. just so that we could toggle between. this part let me highlight it out this. part of the app. and. it will keep on changing based on. whether we select one bottom navigation. bar item or another the next thing I. want to do is make sure that the icons. over here are bigger. so for that we can set some properties. for our bottom navigation bar. what we can do here is set an eigen size. and the icon size here can be 35 save it. and this looks bigger and I like it. the next thing over here is that this. app bar is quite big or the bottom. navigation bar is quite big even on. Android and that's there because. the label occupies some space for. example if I pass in home the home is. displayed over here you see. and the home is displayed that means. label is taking up the space even when. it's empty so what I want to do is make. sure that the selected font size is 0. and unselected font size is also zero if. both of them are zero it will take. lesser space you see and now it works. fine it works well and it looks good in. my opinion perfect now let's go ahead. and design the cart page how do we want. the cart page to look like. so let's close all the save file we're. going to go to the left folder and. create. or we already have the card page created. we'll just go there and start designing. so in our scaffold the first thing that. is required is an app bar just saying. that hey. we are using the cart page so we'll have. a title of app Carter. now you'll notice in. home page that I have a scaffold body. index stack and in the body I have again. mentioned a scaffold so there's a. scaffold inside of a scaffold and that. works fine as long as you don't have an. app bar now if you create an app bar. here. let's just create it for now if you have. an app or over here it will look quite. weird. because you have one app bar and then a. second app bar so definitely you can put. a scaffold inside of a scaffold but it. can look weird so anyways now we have. the given constraints in which we have. to put a scaffold. but our constraint is very clear the. entire screen except this part you know. the bottom navigation bar so our. constraint is this entire thing you can. see. okay. so we'll come over here and let's start. displaying stuff so to display the stuff. we can just use a list view Builder. directly nothing else just unless you. build up. because we don't have anything else to. mention. and here we will also mention the. item count which will be. got dot length and this cart is coming. from Global variables here if you've. copied stuff from. the link mentioned in the description. below. you might have also copied this card. and this card contains just one item. which is the Jordan shoes all right now. you can use that Also let's put context. index inside of an item Builder. now if you're wondering and I didn't. answer this before why is there a. context we understand why there is an. index why is there a context and context. is basically available in all Builder. related. stuff for example if you add future. Builder you could have a context there. if you just have a builder widget which. is a builder it's which is a widget of. itself you'll get a context there as. well. so basically whenever you have Builder. you will have a context and if you're. wondering what the Builder widget does. I'm not talking about listview Builder. the Builder widget only it basically. just provides a context to you. which you can use. and it does have a significance of its. own it will provide you with the build. context that is not same as this context. now in the item here what I want is. final cart item which will be equal to. cart at particular index now what do we. return here well it's a very simple. choice I just want to return a tile that. has one heading one subheading an image. of the. thing we have in cart and a delete. button if I want to remove it from the. card so for that particular reason what. I'm going to return from here is a. widget that you've never seen before and. that is the list style widget. so usually whenever you have list view. Builder list tile goes well because well. it has all the necessary properties you. might need to return. so it has a title that will help you to. display a title stuff so let's have a. text widget here this accepts a widget. and the text can be cart item at title. dot to string. so we have a title that is good. then it also has a subtitle. and here also we can pass it a text. which will be. telling us the size so what number size. shoe did the user select so let's say. the user selected a size of 8.. remember this is just dummy data. when we add State Management to the app. which is the next step we will be able. to dive more into it so we can just have. cart item at size that just looks good. now if you come over here you'll see. Jordan shoes size 8. perfect. the only problem I have is the title is. not bolded so let's go ahead and bold it. out so I'm going to use style property. here but I'm not going to mention the. normal style I'll go to the main dot dot. file and I'm going to copy this. body small. title that looks good to me so I'll just. have theme dot off context Dot text. theme dot body small. then I'll save it and this is now bolded. and it has the same size as 16. no. visible difference there. after this I want to add an image in the. start showing that this is the shoe. you've selected so I just want to show. that so for that we also have another. widget which is or another property. which is leading so what leading does is. put whatever widget you have in the. start. so you can use the leading widget here. and pass in a circle Avatar. and then you pass in the background. image which is a property to use on. Circle Avatar what Circle Avatar. basically does is it gives you a rounded. border where you can describe your. background color background image. foreground image radius minimum radius. all of that stuff. so here you can pass in a background. image and this requires image provider. what is our image well it's coming from. asset so you can pass in an asset image. here you cannot pass in image dot asset. because this is a widget. image.asset is a widget however asset. image isn't. a widget asset image is a network or. is a image provider. if you see here asset image and go into. the definition of the source code you'll. see asset image extends asset buttonal. image provider and it extends an image. provider so it's an image provider it's. not a widget image dot asset is a widget. see here it requires image providers you. can pass an asset image. and if you're getting stuff from Network. or from web you can use Network image. so let's go ahead and use asset image. and pass in the asset my asset is cart. item will go to Global variables and we. have image URL so we'll pass in image. URL and we'll treat it as a string. perfect. we save it and we have our shoes showing. up. now what if I want to increase the size. of this. Circle that we have Circle Avatar has. properties for that as well you can also. set the radius property that will help. you to change the. size of it so let's say the radius is 45. so this is quite big and there you go. but I don't want it this big I want it. 30 let's say. that's fine and if you want to change. the background color over here you can. change it the yellow color is there just. because of the theming we have set in. the overall app and the last thing I. required here is a delete icon now there. are two things you can do away for the. delete icon either you can add a button. over here that says hey you can remove. this item from the card or you can have. a swiping gesture saying if you swipe. this you can delete the item in the cart. or you just long press on it and you can. delete it what I'm going to do is add an. icon over here that says you can delete. stuff. this is helpful because. the user doesn't have to swipe through. or if the user doesn't know that they. have to swipe to remove from the cart. it's helpful. so now you can have a trailing widget. here which will be an icon button. and on press is required so what should. happen if it is removed for now nothing. and then icons dot delete. okay. save it you come over here and you have. the delete icon now the delete icon. isn't in its original fashion in its. original fashion it should be in the red. color so let's get it red so we're going. to have a const icon icons dot delete. and we're also going to press or pass. the color which is colors dot red. and I'm not setting the theme away I'm. generally typing colors.red because no. matter what the theme of our app is the. delete button has to be red color. and we have a delete button cool so we. have our cart layout set up as well now. the next thing we need to add in our app. is State Management so how do we manage. the global state in our app we already. do that with. set state so we are the local state. management but what should happen if I. click on add to cart. and it should show up in the card here. I've already explained all the stuff. related to State Management and. inherited widget which is what flutter. uses behind the scenes to have State. Management but we are going to take a. look at an abstraction over. inherited widget why because inherited. widget can be a bit cumbersome to write. every single time it is quite a big. source code to write and yeah if you. want to know more about it link is. mentioned in the description you should. definitely check out the video by the. flutter team themselves. so now let's dive into the State. Management world and we are going to. manage a state using provider so for. State Management we are going to take. help of an external dependency and for. that I can go to pub.dev and the package. we'll be using is provider. this provider package is a wrap around. inherited Widget the widget that I. explained to you but we did not write. and it is a wrapper around inherited. widget to make them easier to use and it. is more reusable. by using provider instead of manually. writing inherited widget. you get all of these features. all right and it's a good thing. there are other State Management options. you can use as well there's riverpod. which is my personal favorite and you. can find that in the video I'll. mentioned in the description below you. can check out my separate tutorial on it. and after that I would recommend you to. follow with the project of Reddit clone. so that you get a proper practical. understanding of using riverpod in your. apps and another famous library that. people like to use is block and there's. another package that people like to use. in the flutter Community which is get X. but I personally do not like it and. it is the most liked package on pub.dev. so it's the most like package in flutter. but I personally do not like using it. and you can find my video on why I don't. like using it in the description as well. so we are not going to take a look at. get at all and even block. but riverpod you can find in the video. description let's go ahead and use. provider now how should we use provider. so the documentation or usage for it can. be found in the. yeah. but I'm going to tell you how to use it. because that's what the aim is right now. we can copy this go to pubspect.aml. and add it to the dependencies. and then save it now I will get rid of. it. and we'll start all our apps from. scratch now provider runs on every. machine so it can work on all the. platforms you can see it over here so. that's fine and at the end of the day it. is just a wrapper around inherited. widget which basically means like it is. built on inherited widget with a slight. wrapper which allows you to use it very. easily and it is a flood of favorite. package so flutter recommends using this. however the creator of this package is. not the Google team. it is the team or it is the person that. created the riverpod package as well and. he recommends using this package. over provider. however we are going to use provider. because that will give us a clearer. insight into inherited widget. River pod doesn't do that anyways let's. just focus on provider and remove Revo. pod out of the picture. now here let's add provider so the first. thing to do in provider and I told you. about this in inherited widget. explanation as well that. how inherited widget works is it creates. a storehouse at the top of a widget. or at the top of the widget tree. so we can do the same we can go to the. main dot dot and we can wrap our. material app with something known as a. provider widget. okay this provide a widget is coming. from the provider package and it extends. inherited provider in edited provider. extends single child stateless widget. this extends a stateless widget so this. is a widget. that you can use. and the task of this provider is to. store this data. and you store this data using the create. option wire send create you pass any. value it accepts Dynamic value which is. basically like hey you can pass anything. you want it can be your own custom class. you get can be a string so let's go. ahead and return a string from here with. just saves hello world all right I'm. just showing you how to use provider in. your apps so you can build. or provide value from one place to. another. so what you've done is at the top of the. widget tree you said hey we have a. provider and the descending widgets can. use this value. so whatever value we're returning the. descending widgets can use it and if you. hover over this it is automatically. getting a type of Provider string so. whatever value you type over here will. be the type of this provider. cool now we can go to the cart page. let's say. now the thing we have to concentrate on. is how do I get this value how do I get. the value hello world in my cart page. well you can do that by printing. provider. dot of context. and here. we have to mention a generic type now. you already know provider.off context. syntax right it is the inherited widget. syntax. exactly. but this also requires a generic type if. you mention a generic type it will be. able to find the provider so if we have. string here and then let's just say we. printed. you see hello world is written if I. restart the app hello world is written. how does this work how are we getting. the value in my app in the cart Page by. not even giving arguments and that is. the beauty of provider and inherited. widget. we mentioned hello world over here so. this was a provider of type string then. we called provider dot off context so it. went up the widget tree trying to find. the nearest ancestor. to provide a DOT off string. so it. searched the type of Provider string all. right it went up the widget tree and. tried to find a provider which was like. this provider string and then when it. finally founded. it returned the value. now what if I have two providers instead. of one. so I have one provider at the root of. the widget tree and let's say I have. another. which is wrapping the home page all. right I have a provider here which wraps. the home page and let's say we say hello. also this requires a function so let's. pass in a function all right. cool. now if we restart we see Hello written. over here hello world is gone now only. Hello is returned and that's because. provider dot off context is trying to. find the nearest widget to it. or the nearest widget in the widget tree. and the nearest widget is this part over. here. that's why we get hello we don't get. hello and hello world both because once. it finds the particular provider it will. stop looking for any more providers it's. done so it doesn't look any further. it will give the value given by this. hello perfect. so now that we have used provider. I want to tell you that there are. multiple types of providers there are. providers like provider we've already. seen this then we have changed Notifier. provider. then we have a future provider and then. we have a stream provider so these are. the four main types of providers that. you can use in your app. provider we have already seen is a. read-only value so you can just provide. one value and it will only read it will. do nothing else then there's change. nodifier provider with this provider you. can change the values. and notify the widgets that are. listening to it about those changes. this is the provider we want in our. shopping app then we have future. provider so future provider is there so. that it can listen to Futures subscribe. to them and show the changes. and stream provider is basically. providing a stream. future and stream providers are useful. because provider helps in lazy loading. right. so it can help over there and that is a. good thing however we'll be only. focusing on change nodifier Provider. from now so instead of returning a. provider which is a read-only value we. don't need that anymore we're going to. return a change nodifier provider. but if I just do change Notifier. provider. it's not enough. we need to provide a generic type of. error and a generic type as let's say. string but string doesn't conform to the. boundary of change node file basically. whenever you have change Notifier. provider. and you have a create function you. cannot pass in a string or anything you. need to pass in something known as a. change node file okay and what is this. change Notifier it is a simple class in. the flutter SDK which we can use so it's. coming from flutter not from provider. and what this does is provides change. notification to whatever is listening to. it so. if any updates are made or anything is. done it will notify the widgets. listening to it and will rebuild those. changes. but now we cannot just use change. Notifier like this we have to use it a. little bit differently what we need to. do is create our own separate class so. let's call. our provider as cart provider.dot then. we are going to have class card provider. I always like to. have anything related to provider using. cart provider. so it's clear for me to know. if it's a provider or not then we have. to extend this with change node F5 all. right as soon as you extend change. Notifier you can take this class and. return it over here so you can return. card provider over here now. this card provider is accessible. throughout your entire app so whatever. you define over here can be used outside. of this class. in the home page in the cart page. anywhere in your app and that's a plus. right so this just tells us that if I. click on add to cart and I store it in. cart provider then I'll be able to see. it in the card screen if I use the same. card provider and that's exactly what we. are going to do. this card provider is a storehouse right. at the top so here I'm going to create a. variable call this. final. map string comma Dynamic cart and that. is equal to an empty list. but here a value of type less Dynamic. cannot be assigned to a variable of type. map string dynamic. it's basically saying that hey. your card is a map of string comma. Dynamic how are you assigning to this to. a list and that's true my card cannot be. just a map if it's just a map I'll be. able to store one single product I want. to store multiple products so I need to. have a list. okay now that I have a list I can create. two functions add product. and remove product so I'm going to have. remove product. so two functions are present in cart. provider which we can use so in add. product we are going to get one product. which we need to add to our cart so I. can have map string comma Dynamic. product. then I'm going to do cart dot add. product simple. now the same thing is going to happen in. the remove product as well I'm going to. get a product here and then I'm going to. do cart dot remove product. so this way my card provider is up and. ready as simple as that. since the instance of this class is. accessible throughout our entire app I. can go to one particular page and where. I want to go to is product Details page. I hope you understood what happened in. card provider I created a class extended. it using change Notifier so that I could. use it in main.dot in the card provider. over here. and then what I did is ADD product added. it to the cart list remove product those. are just functions and now whenever this. add to cart button is clicked on. I'm going to. call this particular function. okay so let's go ahead and do it so I'm. going to go to the product Details page. then I'm going to go to the elevated. button on pressed and here I'm going to. have provider. dot of context and here I need to. mention the type what is the type of my. provider now if you want to take a look. at it you can come over here. and the type of provider is cart. provider you can use that so you'll have. provider.off cart. provider. Dot and you have the option to add a. product. now I'm just going to click on ADD. product. and then I will mention my map what is. my map. well it's this thing product but you see. I can't access product over here and I. can't access it because I'm in a. stateful widget whenever I'm in a. stateful widget I am unable to access. this product then how did we do it. earlier. widget.parada but we didn't write widget. dot product right. flutter did it for ourselves so when we. add stateless to stateful widget. conversion we wrote widget it. automatically converted product to. widget dot product because we are in a. separate class of ourselves right. how do we access element of this class. we cannot do that. that's why state has created a widget. property or a widget getter for us which. we can use to access Constructor. arguments or whatever we want to do and. that's how we get access to widget dot. product. so I can add the product like this. and now just to see if it is working. I'll press command J. I'll restart my entire app and I'm. getting an error. I am getting an error saying the. following provider not found exception. was thrown building card page so the. error is in card page and the error here. is that provider.off string context was. called and there's no provider which. Returns the string for us in the entire. widget tree we had it but we removed it. and replaced it with cart provider so. this no longer exists that's why we get. provider not found exception so when a. provider doesn't exist in your direct. widget tree. that's when you get provider not found. exception. so let's remove or not remove Provider. from here we are going to print provider. dot of context. cart. provider. Dot card so we're going to print this. thing out and now I'm going to restart. my app I see an empty list I come over. here I click on add to cart and I get an. arrow. the error says that I tried to listen to. a value exposed with Provider from. outside of the widget tree. now this error basically occurred. and you can see the reason below this is. likely caused by an event handler like a. buttons on press that called provider. dot off without passing listen false. basically whenever you use. provider dot off. context you always have to listen to. stuff you're just saying that hey I'm. subscribed to cart provider now any. changes made to cart providers any of. the services I want to subscribe to them. I want to listen to all of those changes. that's what change Notifier also does. when you extend to a change Notifier it. will notify all the widgets that are. listening to it about its state change. here what happened is you're saying. provider.off card provider context so. you're basically saying that hey I want. to listen to card provider but then. you're calling add product function on. it so you're not really listening you're. just. calling a function so whenever you're. calling a function. beside the context you also need to. provide one thing which is listen and. set it to false by default listen is set. to true in our cart page the listen is. set to true all right. but here you're saying listen is false. and then add product and listen should. be false. every time you use this function out of. the build. function all right whenever you use. provider dot off card provider context. out of the build function. listen should be set to false and if. you're in on pressed it is basically out. of the build function because you can. take this on pressed and put it like. this void. on tap. like this right so you're now out of the. build function and then you can pass on. Tab. so now you're out of the build function. and it still works fine now you might. raise a question hey how are we using. build context when we are out of the. build function build context is there. only over here how can you use it over. here I can use it over here thanks to. the state class that we are extending. this date class also gives us access to. the build context and this build context. that the state provides and this build. context is the exact same thing it is. the exact same element so you can use it. wherever you want. but yeah in a stateless Widget the. context is not given because. this context is given by the state class. it is not given by state full widget. so stateless widget cannot give that. only state can and obviously in a. stateless widget we do not extend state. great. so now that we are in a. function outside of the build function. we are using listen false and anytime. you want to call a function from card. provider you have to set listen to false. if you said listen to true you're. basically saying that hey. I'm. in the widget tree I want to. continuously listen to the changes and. that's definitely not the case over here. anyways now that we have understood this. we'll restart the app we'll come over. here we'll add to cart let's open the. terminal nothing shows up. and there's still an empty list. if I add to cart again still nothing. works. if I go back come here let's say add to. cart. still nothing works. so why is this not working. well this is not working because. whenever you use. change Notifier or extend change. Notifier. it doesn't do anything automatically. it only notifies the. widgets listening to it when you call a. particular function which is notify. listeners and this function is given by. change Notifier itself. so you extend change Notifier and you. see it is a mixing class so you can also. do card provider with change notify or. extends to notify same thing and as soon. as you do notify listeners and restart. your entire app come to men's Nike shoes. add to cart. command J and now you see automatically. you have access to. the changes made over here and this data. is coming from the card page so you. update it one place and the data is. stored in some other place that's the. cool thing right. now in the card provider we are going to. do the same thing for notify listeners. of a remove product so when you remove a. product you can have notify listeners. like this. so notify listeners just notifies all. the things that are listening to this. card provider sweet now the problem I. have right now is I cannot display the. data that is coming from this cart. that's because sizes is giving me a list. and it's just giving me a product. what I want. is something like this I want ID title. price image URL company all written over. here but I also want size. since I want size over here I'll have to. modify this widget dot product a little. bit. so how are we going to do this. well we can have something like this. so what I'm going to do is copy this. this is the layout in which I want my. product. or my cart product then I can have it. like this then I mentioned the ID so the. ID is widget dot product at ID and the. same thing for literally every single. thing we have widget dot product title. widget dot product. then we have price then we have widget. dot product image URL. and do that for everything all right. so you have image URL here and finally. widget product. for the company. sweet and the size here is going to be. the selected size. also you can add an if condition over. here what if the user does not select a. size. what do we want to do in that case well. first of all I don't want to update my. cart. otherwise it will come like selected. size is 0. and that's a wrong thing. because a shoe cannot have a size of. zero so I'll just have if selected size. is equal to 0. then. I want to do something else. so I'll just have a reverse condition if. selected size is not equal to 0. then I'm just going to paste it over. here. so if selected size is not zero it is. something else. and that has to be from some selected. size we have decided. then we can go ahead. so now we restart. come over here let's say I add to cart. nothing gets added to the cart and this. is kind of like a bad user feedback you. can say because what's happening here is. you add to cart the user doesn't really. know that they have to select a size. maybe they forgot to do that. so you have to tell the users that hey. you need to select a size. so here in the else condition you can. tell the users that and here I want to. basically show. a thing popping up from below saying. that hey you need to. select a size. so for that we have something known as. scaffold messenger. not scaffold. scaffoldmessenger dot off context again. this is using inherited widget behind. the scenes and I'll explain why Dot. and this has multiple things like show. material Banner remove current snack bar. all of that what we want is show snack. bar and this requires something known as. snack bar so let's pass it in then snack. bar requires content so let's pass the. content which will be a text because. content requires a widget and then you. say. please select a size. okay and then we are going to put a cons. for the snack bar and once we come over. here let's go back come over here. add to cart you see please select a size. so this is our scaffold messenger. showing up why does this use a narrated. widget because it wants to show the. snack bar on one particular screen and. here it is just contacting the messenger. of a scaffold all right earlier this was. known as scaffold.off context but then. it caused some problems with build. context. and cause problems like build context. not found that's why this was renamed to. scaffold messenger. so what happens is it's it Finds Its. nearest scaffold. now it Finds Its nearest scaffold. messenger and shows a snack bar on that. particular scaffold and what is the. snack bar snack bar is a thing that. shows up from the below giving us. an impression that hey you need to do. something. okay. so now if I select a size add to cart. it will be added to cart but I still. have no clue that it was added to my. cart so what I can add here is again a. scaffold messenger and a snack bar. saying. product. added successfully. save it. then you again select some other product. let's say this then you have product. added successfully you go back come over. here. and you won't be able to see the changes. because our card does not depend on it. but the changes are reflected over here. now let's go ahead and make the changes. over here in our cart page. now whenever you want to continuously. listen to something in relation to a. provider we have to do that in the build. context otherwise lesson will be set to. false and we won't be able to listen to. anything. so let's save our final card is this. thing over here. then we'll remove Global variables and. as thing is done. so the item count is card dot length. cart item is cart at index. and now it's safe to say that we can. remove cart from our app. the dummy data still needs to be there. now we can close all the save files we. are going to restart our app. all the data is now gone because. the provider doesn't store data. permanently in our storage it only. stores it temporarily as long as the app. is running after you restart or reset. the app it is all gone. so let's go ahead and select 11 size. then we'll go to Adidas shoes We'll add. a 10 size. then we'll add a Jordan shoes and add. eight size then we come to the cart and. we see three things men's Nike shoes. size 11 10 8 and all the proper images. are showing up perfect. the last thing I want to work on is this. delete product. so whenever I delete something from your. it should remove it from my cart. but even before doing that I want a. confirmation I want my app to ask them. are you sure you want to remove this. product if you're sure only then we'll. remove it for you. we already have the remove product. function ready all we need to do is. put up a dialog box what we want is. whenever we click on this particular. button it should show up a dialog box. right in the center saying delete choose. or delete from to delete product are you. sure you want to remove products from. cart and then you have two options no. yes so this is what you want to do let's. go ahead and do that really quickly. so in card page. Whenever there is on pressed you can. have something known as show dialog. this show dialog is a function given by. flutter that will allow you to display. UI it will allow you to show a dialogue. on the screen. and then it has a builder so you get a. context and you can use that context to. display stuff now this Builder requires. you to return a widget from this. function of build context that it's. giving. now what do we want to return well I. just want to return a dialogue let's say. if I have a dialog. will that work well let's go ahead and. try it out you see when I click over. here the screen does get blurred. that's because of our dialogue now I'll. pass a child here and the child is let's. say text and we say are you sure. then become aware we select we see a. dialogue saying are you sure. so you can set it up for yourself you. know you can design dialogues on your. own I have that much faith in you at the. end of the day we are returning a widget. so you can use container padding column. all of your creativity to return a. particular dialogue but if you don't. want to do all of this there is a. built-in widget called alert dialog. which you can use and I like to use it. for this kind of stuff. this basically tells you to show an. alert dialogue that hey you're doing. something. that is a bit risky not exactly risky in. this case you're just removing a product. from your cart but it just verifies that. hey you're doing this. so let's go ahead and set it up it. requires a title which is exactly what. we want so we are going to have. delete product as the title. now when we click over here delete. product is the title. and you see that this is quite big I. don't want it this big and the reason. it's big is because the title has. a style it is. inheriting from. we can override that by having theme. dot off context Dot. text theme. Dot. let's say body medium save it. this doesn't look very good so I'm going. to go with something large which is. title large let's say now if I click. over here this is quite big. maybe we want title medium. and this looks good enough. so we have delete product as the main. title after that we need something like. a subtitle. and there's nothing like a subtitle but. we do have content. so what is our content well very simply. it is a text saying are you sure you. want to remove. the product. from your cart. okay. this is my content this is my text. widget. just asking it are you sure you want to. do this. because this is an alert dialogue it. just asks for your confirmation now if I. click over here we see this this is. looking good. the last thing I want here is a no and a. yes button so that the users can select. accordingly. and for that we have something given by. alert dialog which is actions actions is. the same thing that is available on the. app bar as well which you can use to add. action related stuff. things that you want to mention over. here. and the same thing is here as well if. you want to mention something so I want. two things over here. two text buttons basically the first. vertex button is going to be a text. saying. no. also this will be a constant text no and. then there's going to be another text. button which is going to be yes all. right. now if we click over here. we don't see the buttons but they are. there no and yes now we just have to. change their design. so for this we'll have to set up the. style and everything so let's go ahead. and. pass the style as. text button or actually we don't need to. do this we can just mention the style. over here for the text textile now what. is the color of no going to be well I. just want it to be. colors.blue because no is a safer option. and the other option Also let's put. fontway dot boldier and the other option. which I'm going to copy paste is yes. and that is going to be colors.red. now if you click over here yes is there. no is there you can select either of. them. you can set more properties on this show. dialog basically like if you want to. disallow the user from clicking outside. right now if I click outside of the. dialog I can still exit but if you want. to make sure the users can avoid that. you can set barrier dismissable to false. once you do that the users won't be. allowed to click outside. and exited like this I can't exert it. even though I'm clicking. but anyways I like this better so I'm. going to keep it. and now I can't exit it so I'm just. going to restart my app. then add some shoes. come over here and we have men's Nike. shoes size 11 and size 12 properly there. now in the know what I want to do is. whenever the user clicks on no I just. want this dialog to go away and do. nothing just this dialogue should go. away. so to make this dialog go away I can use. Navigator dot off context dot pop. once I do this. and click on no it just removes the. dialogue nothing else because what this. dialog does is it. Stacks it it Stacks it at the top of the. screen so navigator.off context dot pop. will just remove it. after this we have yes in yes what do we. have to do well I just want to call. provider dot off context then again I. have to access cart provider. then lesson should be set to false don't. forget that dot remove product. and what is the product I want to remove. the product is mentioned over here it is. the cart item so you can just mention. the cart item and done. now if you want to remove Adidas shoes. you can click on yes and Adidas shoes. gets removed but the dialogue isn't. popped off. we still have to call navigator.off. context dot pop to remove this thing. so let's click on no now we have delete. button yes and will clear off the card. for us now we can go ahead and set. things up let's say 10. 9. and now if I come over here yeah size 10. size 9 and I can remove anything I want. and it works fine. so this was what I wanted to talk about. State Management with provider. provider has its flaws for sure. but this is very close to inherited. widget which is why I wanted to take. this up now there are some things you. can modify here first of all this is a. big line to ride. isn't it so what you can do is final. card is equal to context dot watch. as soon as you do context.watch provider. gets triggered then you have to use the. cart provider. and there you go. you now have an instance of cart. provider with you now you just have to. call the cart and it will work just as. intended. so we have context.watch here instead of. provider.off card provider context Dot. card so this is a shorthand Syntax for. the same thing. it will work just as expected you can. try it for yourself. and here whenever we have. a function called what we need to do is. context dot read. you can't use context.watch because. lesson Falls means read it isn't watch. watch is basically like your. continuously seeing read is you just. read it once and leave it. so again you need to mention card. provider over here and then you can have. dot remove product and pass in the. particular card either. and you can make these changes. everywhere in your app. it is just a shorthand Syntax for it it. is. a function which basically does provide. a DOT off context this lesson Falls. and I think this is an extension yeah. this is an extension on build context. provided by flutter. so yeah you can you do this to simplify. your life. and that works great looks great perfect. now you can make these changes all. around your app and this is how it is. done so yeah we are done with State. Management with provider in our shopping. app. one last thing I'd like to mention. before closing the State Management. chapter with provider if you want to. return multiple providers in a bigger. application what you can do and I'm. going to remove this comment is return. multi-provider with multi-provider you. can return a list of providers and there. you can mention your change Notifier. provider where you pass in a context and. return card provider. as simple as that so if you have. multiple providers you can pass it in. multi-provider otherwise change Notifier. provider or just provider is fine but. most of the times in bigger apps you. will be using multi-provider only. because you will have multiple providers. there's a lot less boilerplate code to. write when using provider as it is a. wrapper around inherited widget a widget. provided by flutter itself to pass data. between other widgets using provider we. can separate business logic from UI. making our code much easier to test and. maintain in this tutorial we will go. through different type of providers and. understand when to use what type of. Provider first one is provider itself as. the name suggests provider provides data. to visits below it in the widget tree to. demonstrate this I'll wrap the root of. my widget tree with provider this acts. like a storehouse for data. wait a minute which data whatever we. pass in the create argument it can be. string Boolean and even instance of a. class. to read this data in a widget we can use. provider dot off then the type of the. data we return followed by context. what happens behind the scenes is it. goes up the widget Tree finds the. provider widget closest with the type we. return and spits out the data that's. stored we can see the data correctly. when we display it on the screen as well. if you find the syntax really long you. can use context.watch followed by the. type of provider and it will work the. same way provider is a read-only widget. which means it cannot modify the value. initially passed to it so how do we. modify the values with the help of. change nodifier provider instead of. Provider we will pass in chain Notifier. provider and in the create argument pass. in a data model. to create a data model we will create a. Class instantiate A Private variable. create a getter and a function that. increments the variable's value by 1. to. make this work properly with change. nodifier provider extend the class with. chain Notifier which provides us with. notify listeners function whenever this. function is called it notifies chain. Notifier provider and widgets listening. to it are rebuilt. if you don't use notify listeners the UI. of the app won't get affected even. though the data in our case counter. variables value changes. also note that more functions like. decrement and reset can be added in the. model class itself getting data is same. for all providers we just need to. specify the type of Provider properly. since we have counter return in chain. nodifier provider we will replace string. with counter but as you can see this. returns instance of the counter class so. we will use counter getter we created in. this class to see the count. now to implement the increment function. we can use this line why let's break it. down provider dot off counter context. will return to us the instance of the. counter class on this instance we are. calling increment function inside of. which we call notify listeners and this. will rebuild this widget since we are. listening to it but what if I don't want. to listen meaning I don't want the. widget to rebuild so I can set listen to. false for a shorter syntax we can use. context dot read it's worth noting that. context.read cannot be called inside. build function on the other hand. context.watch cannot be called outside. of build function another thing to note. is context.watch should generally be. used when every part of the widget needs. that value because it makes the entire. widget rebuilt for example when I click. on the increment button only the counter. needs to rebuild but in reality even the. text and floating action button rebuild. this might not seem like a big. difference but what if you're building. Twitter like app and to update the. number of likes you're rebuilding the. whole postcard to prevent this. unnecessary widget rebuild wrap the. counter text with consumer widget which. will make only the widget returning from. it rebuild give consumer the return data. type and to get the data we can use. instance of return data type provided to. us don't forget to remove your. context.watch calls otherwise it will. still rebuild the entire widget next. type of provider is stream Provider from. the name itself we know that it will. help us manage stream data it is like. stream Builder but with lesser. boilerplate instead of chain Notifier. wrap my app with stream provider in the. create argument pass in a stream like. this in our case it will output 0 to 9. with a gap of 1 second after each number. initial data argument is also required. it is the data to be displayed until the. above stream gives us a value to read. this go down to the consumer replace. counter within which is the data type we. are returning from stream provider and. remove dot counter it works prop if you. restart the app. equivalent of consumer in this case will. be the following. future provider is similar to stream. provider it too accepts initial data and. create arguments and works the same way. so I'm not going to rewrite the whole. thing but basic difference is future. provider returns a value after the. future is completed now we know about. most of the essential providers but here. comes a problem what if I want to use. both stream provider and change Notifier. provided together in the application we. can do something like this right wrap my. app with provider pass data in create. and in the child change Notifier. provider likewise we can do for hundreds. of providers in a vast app right. no why use this nesting hell well only a. single provider can help us which is. multi-provider it accepts list of. providers in the argument and that's it. that's how easy it is to add multiple. providers in our application now the. last provider we're going to look at is. proxy provider when one of our provider. depends on value returned from another. provider we use proxy provider to. demonstrate this I'll create another. class in a code called second class and. accept instance of Firebase odds from. Constructor here we can create any. method that we want I'll just keep it. empty now I want to provide this class. so I'll go into the multi provider where. Firebase auth is already provided to. access this Firebase auth instance I. will use proxy provider the syntax is. like this proxy provider and unlike. other providers we pass two types. independent class and the dependent. class then we need to pass update. argument which gives us context followed. by instance of the independent and. dependent classes we will return the. class from this function passing auth as. the argument this will make a provider. work but what if the class doesn't need. one but two three even four instances we. will use proxy provider 2 3 4 and so on. for it and that's pretty much it the. next thing I want to do is focus on. responsive UI by responsive UI I mean. the device or our app should look good. on all screen sizes and that includes. Chrome. Mac OS Apple Android all of them it. should look good on all the screen sizes. so right now our app looks good on IOS. and Android and that's cool but now I'm. going to switch to Chrome and I'm going. to run it on Chrome to see how it looks. on a bigger screen size all right so. let's launch it. and while that is happening I also want. to restructure the folder structure now. you see there are many components in our. lib folder so obviously we need to. segregate things we need to put all the. pages in one particular page we want to. put providers in one provider. and we need to do all of those tasks so. let's go ahead and do it in the lab we. are going to go ahead and create a Pages. folder then I'm going to take cart page. drag it in pages. then I'll may let extension dot make the. changes and save those changes. then I'll put home page as well. then we are done with that let's save it. after that we need another folder and we. are going to name it widgets this is. going to contain small widgets not. exactly pages but smaller widgets so. we'll pass in the product card let's. move it in. and let's save the changes and one thing. I forgot to do was put product Details. page in pages so let's put it there. save it and then the last thing is I. think provide a product list and product. list also goes in the pages. so we have widgets and pages so this is. good for a smaller application then in. the lip folder I'm also going to create. providers and as our app skills we are. going to have more providers right. so we are going to create a separate. providers where all the providers are. going to stay like cart provider also. save those changes if you don't save it. it will give error in your app so we. have Pages provider widgets and Global. variables can stay here. or you can create a utils folder and. save it in utility but I don't like to. do that utility includes some other. things not exactly Global variables. Global variables can be constants. or something else all right so we have a. cleaner folder structure here. the purpose of a clean folder structure. is that you can. just have your apps layout very nicely. and more Engineers working on it will be. a better thing all right and even the. Chrome is now set up so if you come over. here and expand the app there is Chrome. and this looks decent enough not bad not. good. if we come to the product list over here. we are getting an error and this error. is there because it wasn't able to find. something we just need to restart. because this happened when we were. changing the folders right now if you. come over here the error is gone perfect. so what are the changes we need to make. well the first change as you can see in. the details men's Nike shoes. this shoe image is quite big I want to. reduce the shoe image size and that's. not just for one shoe even this shoe is. quite big. so let's go to the product Details page. and scroll down we'll find our. image.asset and as you can see this. error is there because we haven't set a. particular height for it and what should. the height be well let's go ahead and. see it the height should be 250 let's. say if we do that come over here. this shows up nicely and if we go to the. iOS device. over here and we click on it we have 250. showing up this looks cool it works on. both the screen sizes. let's click over here and yeah this. looks cool I'm fine with it also if you. right click on Chrome. click on inspect you'll be clicking on. this icon over here to toggle device. toolbar and now you can check for the. responsive design from here itself right. and as you can see when we increase the. font size the maximum height it takes is. what we've mentioned over here 250 and. when we shrink the size the image height. keeps on decreasing so that's a good. thing for us right. even for our button if you see that's. the case the button keeps on increasing. and it takes the entire width of the. screen. with the padding there now I don't want. this what I want is the button to only. be there. only this much. just like our. shoe all right so it shouldn't be this. big because it looks kind of weird. doesn't it so we can scroll down to our. button and here you see we have set up. the minimum size how this works is it. the minimum size it can take is double. dot infinity and then we've wrapped it. with padding. so they're spacing over here. however what we can see here is maximum. size can be this much. then when we click. you see this is quite small because the. maximum size it can take is this so we. have set up a constraint over here that. maximum size is this much minimum size. can be whatever you. have the child as how much ever size the. child requires and same happens over. here although I'm pleased with the. result this is not what we want so we. are going to use fixed size over here. because maximum size gives us. a very small result minimum size gives. us a very big result. fixed size will give us exactly what we. want so instead of passing in double dot. Infinity I'll pass 250. this is good enough and if I pass 350. Come Away. you see this looks good enough. the problem then comes on the pixel. emulator all right if we just open it. and take a look if it looks good enough. let's run it without debugging if it. works well on the pixel emulator then. we're fine with that it all looks good. but if it doesn't then something needs. to change. and we have the pixel emulator. if I click on a product add to cart is. there and it's similar to this thing. over here perfect I like it this way so. this works well on the. screens on all the screens in fact so we. are done with the product detail screen. the selecting part is still the same we. can add to cart we can go back come to. the shopping cart and we'll see our. product. and here if I click on delete delete. product everything looks good it's all. good in my opinion you know the dialogue. takes only this much space which is what. I want. then. this is the size that I want I only. wanted this much so everything looks. good over here but the problem I have. right now is this card over here this. card takes in a lot of width and this. width is fine over here this width is. completely perfect but over here it's. taking in a lot of width what I want to. do instead is if we exceed a certain. screen size or screen width let's. inspect the tab and come over here so if. I reach let's say this much height. let's say this much height. then I. automatically want to show double cards. so I want two cards to be displaying on. the single screen. and when we are less than that. particular dimension. I want only one card to display so it. depends on what the screen size is. again just to tell you if I expand this. I want two cards but when I have it. minimized like it's in a phone mode I. want it this long I only want one card. to be present otherwise two cards so how. can I make this happen that's where we. have another widget in place frada gives. it to us what is that. if we just come to the home page and in. the home page we have to go to the. product list. in the list view Builder. now this listview Builder this list view. Builder is for filters and filters look. great. this is the thing I'm worried about this. list view Builder over here. now instead of returning one list over. here. I'm going to have grids and it depends. on the screen size right. so how do I calculate the device width. so for that particular reason we have. final. size which is equal to Media query. this media query gives us a lot of. things it will give us what platform we. are on what is our screen height what is. our screen size what is our screen width. what mode are we on so like if the phone. is in a straight mode or if it is in a. horizontal mode like this it will give. us all of that data. so it's pretty helpful for us yes you. can click over here to change the mode. of the app or mode of the phone. if it's portrait mode or horizontal mode. whatever. so media query gives us access to all of. that so what I want is mediaquery dot. off context dot size you can see over. here it gives us a lot many more things. like view padding View and such platform. brightness and you can look at all the. things it gives us but what I want is. size why because size will give me the. perfect size and then it will give me. the size of the media and logical pixels. example the size of the screen that's. what I want. and also you'll see away a media query. dot off context and if you see over here. for the media query itself it extends. something known as inherited model not. inherited widget a narrated model is. kind of like inherited widget but. there is a slight difference we are. going to talk about. let me just. tell you how this works how we can make. two cards appear on a bigger screen and. only one card on a smaller screen and. then we can talk about the difference. between inherited model and inherited. widget. and how it affects us. so we'll scroll down and here where our. list view Builder is there expanded is. there in the child. so first of all let me make it clear. that whenever we want to display two. items. in. kind of like a grid what we use is grid. view Builder so just like listview. Builder there's grid view Builder and. obviously there is grid view as well. which you can use. but great view Builder is used when you. don't know the number of items the grid. is going to have in our case products. dot length is the number of items in. Grid View and list view both as of right. now we know what the products length is. but if we make database connections and. we dynamically get it from the database. we won't know how many products are. there just think of Amazon does Amazon. know how many products there are they. are like billion products they can't. possibly know how many exact items or. products are there. that's why there is item Builder and. grid view Builder widgets. so we are going to use grid view Builder. and just to give you a demonstration I'm. going to comment this out I'm only going. to have expanded again because this ba. is similar to listview Builder it will. take in the. entire height of the screen but it. doesn't have the entire height. so we have to wrap it with expanded then. we are going to have grid view Builder. this requires grid delegate and then it. requires sliver grid delegate this grid. delegate controls the layout of the. children so this will tell it how many. items we want in a row how many. items should have how much spacing so. all of that configurations can be made. with sliver grid delegate so let's type. it out sliver grid delegate but then it. is an abstract class abstract classes. are made so that we can use their. subtypes which follows a particular. attribute for example get layout and. should relay relay out. should be followed by every class that. extends or implements sliver grid. delegate that's why abstract classes are. made and your abstract classes are. allowed. here I can pass in anything sliver grid. delegate related for example sliver grid. delegate with fixed cross access count. sliver grid delegate with fixed with Max. cross access counts level Grid delegate. with fixed cross access so all of that. is present aware what we want is sliver. grid delegate with fixed cross access. count. here we get an error but this error is. not because this is an abstract class. this isn't. this is a normal class but requires a. named argument but before jumping into. that let's format it and understand what. this means sliver grid delegate with. fixed cross access count we know what. sliver grid delegate is it's this thing. that it requires to control the layout. of our children. in the grid view Builder obviously. with fixed cross access count basically. means how many items you want in one row. in the product list or in the grid view. Builder. and how many do we want to display in. one particular row I want to display. let's say two widgets at the most. so here we have to pass in a required. argument of cross access count which. will be 2.. now consider grid view as a column right. all the widgets are going to be one. below another so consider it a column by. passing in Cross access you're basically. mentioning everything in a row format. that's what column does right when you. pass in Cross access alignment you pass. in the alignment in horizontal Direction. that's what we are doing here so let's. put Constable error then we are going to. have context index just like we had with. list View. and then we want the exact same thing. that we had over here so let's go ahead. and uncomment this. we can copy this gesture detector and. return it over here. then again we can comment the list view. Builder I only uncommented because I. wanted to copy stuff now it requires. product. what is the product well first of all we. have to mention the item count even grid. view Builder has the same thing item. count so let's go ahead pass in products. dot length and product is going to be. final product. is equal to. products at index. great all the errors are now gone the. warning is up there over here and it's. there because of the size variable that. we've never used we're going to use it. in just a moment after we understand how. grid view Builder works now let's. restart become aware and we see two. products displaying in a grid format. perfect. now if you come over here. we have the same thing displaying but. this error here is Justified because it. just looks so awful on a mobile screen. however this looks cool enough over here. right two products and this looks better. however we have a problem over here we. are going to fix that problem but first. of all we just want to configure the. layout such that on smaller screen sizes. we use a list view Builder otherwise a. grid view Builder. so it's very simple we just want to get. the device size. and that device size should not exceed. 600 or 650 which is what the normal. devices. size is. and then accordingly we can display a. grid view Builder so basically. we want to check if the device width is. greater than 650 if it is greater than 6. with 50 that means we want a grid view. Builder because it's a bigger screen. size however if we are less than 650. screen width then we want to display a. list view Builder because it's a smaller. screen size so we can take the size. then. we can uncomment this line. and then have our if condition laid out. what is the rift condition. it's a ternary operator we are just. going to have size dot width so with. size dot width I get access to the. device width this is not the width of. any widget or any constraints. it doesn't follow any constraints of. padding or whatever it just gives us the. entire device width so here I'm just. checking if size dot width is greater. than. 650 then I want list view Builder or. grid view Builder sorry so I'll copy. grid view Builder. cut it also remove expanded from here. because expanded is already there at the. top and then we are going to have grid. view Builder like this. otherwise we are going to display a list. view Builder. so if size dot width is greater than 650. we show a grid view Builder otherwise a. list view Builder works so a grid view. Builder is still shown here however a. list view Builder is shown here that's. perfect exactly what I wanted. so this is where media query can help us. media query can also help us to size the. widgets. according to what we want if we want. this widget size to be bigger it can be. bigger if we want it to be smaller it. can be smaller. now let's come over here and try to fix. this. device height why are we getting such a. big device height over here. so why is this thing over here exceeding. to understand that we must first analyze. on a smaller screen on a smaller screen. this looks good it's perfect exactly the. way I wanted it so there's definitely no. issue in the product card otherwise you. might think hey product card is taking. too much height no we have not. explicitly set any height for our. product card for our container and. that's how it should be. first you should never mention the. height. you should always try to use flexible. expanded all of those widgets whenever. you're using you shouldn't specifically. go ahead and type hey I want to use this. height when things become uncontrollable. by expanded double dot Infinity all of. those stuff then you need to explicitly. mention a height just like we did with. the add to cart button. I'll summarize this at the end but as of. right now no we are not going to. change the height in the product card. because it's all good it is taking as. much height as it should on a list view. Builder but it's not doing the same on. grid view Builder so there's a problem. with grid view Builder and what is the. problem. you can Google it but if I have to tell. you the problem is this child aspect. ratio over here the child aspect ratio. is the ratio of. may cross axis extend to main access. extent and that is one meaning cross. access extent is this big then main. access extent should also be this big. they should have a ratio of one so cross. axis extend divided by main axis extent. should be one that means both should be. the same value and that's why it's. exceeding but in our case we don't want. that if both have the same height and. width that means it is a square and. clearly we don't have a square over here. it's a rectangle. so we can edit the value here and set. child aspect ratio to let's say 1.5 save. it and you see. it becomes shorter but still not enough. I still want it shorter so maybe I can. go till 1.75. and you might be satisfied with it. but I'm not I can say child aspect ratio. to True 2 and this looks good in my. opinion it looks brilliant. so I hope you understood it we made it. such that the main. such that the cross access extent is. double the size or extent of main access. extent. just think about it. child aspect ratio is equal to cross. axis upon main axis. if cross axis is 100. then 100 divided by 50 will give us 2.. so cross axis is double the extent of. main axis. so on Cross access you see it's this big. it's this big it's double the extent of. this mean axis. all right. so we have fixed the error over here and. this looks much better and it does feel. like a web app which is perfectly laid. out so yeah we have this and everything. about it looks good. so I'm satisfied with what we have over. here in terms of responsive design. so this was about the media query and. the power of media query media query. should always be used whenever you want. to get the size of the screen the device. width or device height of the screen. and to talk about the difference between. inherited model and inherited widget by. extending inherited model you can listen. to one particular. property all right so in inherited. widget let's say media query dot off. context is called. and let's say the value of device pixel. ratio changed let's just assume okay the. value of device pixel ratio changed. but in our app we are using. mediaquery.off context dot size. so in reality the value of device pixel. ratio changed but this will still get. called the build function will still. rebuild because that's what inherited. model or inherited widget do whenever. there's a change. they will rebuild the entire build build. function and if they do that. unnecessarily my widgets are getting. called. so this is what happens in inherited. widget. you can't listen to one particular. property in inherited widget your in. general listening to any changes in. media dot mediaquery dot off context and. then you're just saying that give me the. size it's fine. but if device pixel ratio changes this. build function will get rebuilt for no. reason at all because the size didn't. change the pixel device ratio changed. so this is just an example I'm not. saying pixel device ratio will change. and that will happen no nothing like. that will happen. but I'm just telling you and if. condition or an edge case that can. happen and this happens in inherited. widget with inherited model what you can. do is Media query dot size of context or. you can do media query Dot. device pixel ratio of context with this. what you've done is you're just. listening to one particular property. you're just listening to the size. changes of the device. you're not listening to anything else at. all you're not listening to the changes. in device pixel ratio you're not. changing you're not listening to changes. in some other property in media query. you're just listening to the changes in. size so this is what inherited model. does inherited model will help you. select one feature to listen to or one. property to listen to inherited widget. listens to everything entire class all. right so that was the difference and. here I am using size of context because. I only want to listen to the size. cool now if I restart it will look the. same thing so now that we've talked. about media query I also want to cover. One widget which is very helpful and I. use it all the time when I want to make. my layouts and that is the layout. buildup widget. so I'll remove media query from here. because it's. different from media query but. in this case it is going to replace. media query. so let's comment this thing out. okay. and what is this layout Builder widget. so first I'm just going to type the code. out then I'll explain what this layout. Builder widget does. so. for layout Builder widget I'm just going. to have layout Builder like this Builder. which will give me context. and something known as box constraints. all right now we'll figure out what this. box constraints is what this box. constraints is is it gives us a bunch of. constraints which we need to follow to. lay out our app. so if I just print stuff constraints. Dot and let's say Max height which is. the main. thing then we have Max. width then we have minimum height and. minimum width. all right and then we are going to. return a text from your let's say and. that just says hello. so nothing to fancy here and we see a. hello nothing else a very simple text is. returned and you might think there is no. purpose of layout Builder but when you. open the terminal you'll see. constraints dot Max height over here is. infinity constraints dot Max height. again I don't know why we haven't. changed it we want maximum width. then minimum height and minimum width. all right. now we can restart again and we see over. here Max height is infinity. Max width is 1440. and minimum height and minimum width is. zero what is this giving us well layout. Builder gives us the constraints in. which it is for example a certain widget. might impose some constraint on us right. let's say layout Builder is wrapped with. a widget which is size box and has a. height of 100 width of 200 let's save it. we restart the app here you see the. constraints have changed now the max. height is 100 Max width is 200 minimum. height is 100 and minimum width is 200. meaning minimum and maximum width is 200. what we have specified over here and. maximum and minimum height is 100 what. we have specified over here. so what layout Builder does is it gets. its constraints from the parent widgets. so whatever which constrains the parent. widgets give it. it has those in its mind and it will. tell us about those constraints that's. why earlier when we didn't have any. constraint at all it gave us Infinity. because it can take how muchever space. it requires then we add maximum width. the maximum width would be the width of. this device and it is one four four zero. you can check it for M1 Max. and then the minimum I hit and minimum. width can be zero so you can make sure. that your. widget returned from your can be of. heightened with 0 or it can be any. height or a width till one four four. zero so it gives you certain set of. constraints According to which you need. to follow. so that's what layout Builder does. it cares about what restrictions are put. on it. what constraints the container size box. padding widget give to it so here we are. just going to take this constraints to. know what is the height and the width. all right. so we are just going to have if. constraints dot maximum width is greater. than 650. so since it is a builder it is a. function at the end of the day we want. to return a widget but I'm putting an if. condition over here. and since this is a function I can put. an if condition like this if we were in. UI I would put if condition like this. and there would be no braces all right. but we are not in UI we are in a build. of function and in function. I have to put a curly bracket because. that's what DART requires anyways if the. constraints.max width is greater than. 650 then I want to show a grid view. Builder. so let's return grid view Builder make. sure to return it. and as you can see when I save it it. doesn't format it automatically the core. formatting doesn't work because there's. an error and this error is there because. we have one if condition in place so if. constraints dot Max width is greater. than 650 then we return a grid view. Builder okay but what if it is not. greater than 650 like our iPhone what. should we do in that case then we will. have an else condition and there we are. going to return a list view Builder so. let's copy this. then we are going to return. a list view Builder sweet Also let's Pro. remove one pattern thesis make sure. everything is correct over here let's. restart the apps on iPhone Chrome and. everything. and we see an error over here and the. same error over here. that error is there because render. viewport and we have some boxing related. problems. so basically what we need to do. is remove the expanded from grid view. Builder. and we've already removed the expander. from list view Builder. then we are going to wrap. the widget with expanded right now if we. save it everything shows up correctly. and even here everything shows up. correctly. so expanded says take as much space and. width as you require so here if we try. to print constraints dot Max height. and if we try to print constraints dot. Max width we should be seeing a value. let's restart we see 535 and 430 for. iPhone and when we go to Chrome. and restart we see 570. now the max. height instead of infinity it is 570. because that's how much space it is. getting because that's what expanded. does right I hope you got a better. understanding of it through layout. Builder. and as the name suggests it helps you to. build layouts. and the max width doesn't change because. there is no constraint or there's. nothing over here. however Max height did change. so yeah. we just need to wrap expanded to layout. Builder then we return a grid view. Builder without expanded because. expanded is there for our layout Builder. we are getting the constraints properly. now and the same goes for listview build. up you're getting our constraints. properly set up so this is layout. Builder now you might ask what is the. difference between media query and. layout Builder the difference is Media. query takes the entire device width and. the entire device size no matter what. the restrictions on the widget are but. layout Builder takes width and height. based on the restrictions imposed by the. parent widgets on it and that's why I'll. likely out build a better because you. always want to build your widgets based. on what the parent gives you whatever. sizing the parent will give you you need. to follow that if media query doesn't. obey that then it's a problem. but if layout Builder. is telling you some constraints it it's. because of the parent constraints and we. need to follow that for example if I. come over here add to cart button let's. say has some restrictions imposed by its. parent widget I shouldn't be using media. query dot size of context or media. query.off context dot size because then. I'll be taking the entire width of the. screen. I only want to take as much width and as. much height as my parent allows me to do. that's why layout Builder is. used more often in my code I don't use. media query that often. in certain cases yes you do want the. screen width but in this case layout. Builder works fine so we are using. layout Builder I also hope you. understood the Box constraints here it. gives you the constraints you can have. for your. widgets that you want to return and you. can check based on that also when you. print stuff here. like Max height and Max with press. command J. restart we get 517 and 1440 then I'll. click on inspect. and then you see. the layout changed the height is still. the same but the width decreased. so this is what I wanted to show to you. and then we are getting an error over. here. saying that hey this is not enough. so maybe we do need to set the child. aspect ratio at 1.75. and then it will work on all the screen. sizes. I think it works till 1080 so we can. push it till 1080 so if constraints dot. Max width is greater than 1080 width. so if you have this we have two cards. showing up otherwise just one card okay. so this works better I guess and as you. can see when I increase. this card also increases right if you. just. come over here a little bit over here. you see the device or the card is. shrinking in. its. height and width but when I increase the. width of the device it increases as well. so this is the beauty of child aspect. ratio you can configure it the way you. want it to work I think greater than. 1080 is fine because all laptops have a. width greater than 1080 at least I'm. hoping that so yeah this was about. layout Builder and this is how it's. different from media query. now you can play around with it and make. the weather app. responsive as well I didn't make it. responsive for this particular reason I. wanted to teach over here where we would. have better examples and then I would. ask you to do it for weather app and. send me the code if you want me to. review it I'll review it for you. so this was all about responsive UI that. I wanted to share so to sum it up for. you try not to size your widgets because. most widgets don't need an explicit size. given to it they don't need sizes like. 350 300 250 given to it they can take up. the space they need if you have a widget. like list view Builder which needs the. entire device height then you can use. widgets like expanded to give it all the. available space. and expanded is generally used in a. column widget or a row widget if your. widget does need a size however then. give it a height of let's say 40 100 150. 200 whatever. because this height is in logical pixels. and logical pixels basically promise. that your widget will have the same. physical size on all devices so this. means if your widget has a size of your. thumb on one of your device then it will. have the size of your thumb on all. devices. and the third option is to use a layout. Builder or media query and I've already. explained the difference between both of. them to you so this marks the end of the. flutter beginners course we've covered a. lot in this course but there's a lot. more to learn I wasn't able to cover all. the widgets as there are more than 200. to 300 widgets and flutter the point. isn't to know about all the widgets it's. about understanding how widgets should. be laid out how State Management and the. flutter framework work if you've. understood that you're ready to build. apps on your own if you want to know. more about databases you can watch. Instagram or Reddit clone tutorials. present on this channel so I hope you've. mastered the basics in flutter and you. found some value in this tutorial thank. you so much for watching and I'll see. you in the next video\""
